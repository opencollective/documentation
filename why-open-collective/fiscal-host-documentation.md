# Fiscal Host Documentation

Before you dive into the wild world of Open Collective, we wanted to make sure you're in the right place! \


The Open Collective Documentation is our primary documentation, enabling our users to use the Open Collective platform successfully.

\
We encourage our[ Fiscal Hosts](https://opencollective.com/hosts) to link to our main documentation for basic tutorials on using Open Collective. We also aim to link to our Fiscal Hosts' documentation in specific areas to provide further information when needed.\
