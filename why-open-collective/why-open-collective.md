# Why Open Collective?

All over the world, groups are forming to make a difference. Grassroots groups. Solidarity organizations. Open Source projects. Incubators and non-profits.

But not all of these groups last. Some can’t keep up with the burden of obtaining legal status, doing taxes, and more.

Many amazing initiatives don’t get the support and attention they need to thrive, and when that happens, we all lose out.

Open Collective is our solution. We’ve built an open-source ecosystem where Collectives can connect with hosts that help them get set up, manage their administration, and raise and pay money securely and transparently.

Change can’t wait for someone else. It starts with you and me. So we’ve created a place to make it happen.
