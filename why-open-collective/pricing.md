# Pricing

**Our dream is a world where collectives and their ecosystems can thrive. That’s why our pricing is designed to support groups as they grow, while keeping us sustainable.**\
\
Here is a list of fees that may apply on our platform:

### Fees for Collectives

**Platform Fees**

If you’re starting an [Independent Collective](broken-reference), Open Collective gives you unlimited access to all of our platform's features for fre&#x65;**.** Independent Collectives use their bank account and manage their taxes and admin, and are not supported by a Fiscal Host.\
\
**Host fees**

If you join a Fiscal Host, they will often charge a “host fee”. This helps them to cover all the services they provide for Collectives, including taxes, admin, payment approval, and compliance. Typically, this is between 4% and 10%, but it can be higher depending on the services offered.&#x20;

Instead of taking a flat, monthly, or annual fee, hosts will instead charge for a percentage of any contributions you bring in through the platform. For example, if your Fiscal Host charges a 10% fee, 10% of each contribution made to your Collective will go to the Fiscal Host.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Host fees are charged based on the total amount of contributions received, before any payment processor fees are deducted.
{% endhint %}

**Payment Processing Fees** \
\
Services such as Stripe, PayPal, or Wise charge processing fees for any payments you make. Open Collective and your Fiscal Host will not add any additional costs for the processing of payments.



### Fees for Fiscal Hosts

Fiscal Hosts play a vital role in the Open Collective ecosystem. That’s why we choose to charge only based on your level of success.

If you, as a Fiscal Host, do not charge host fees to Collectives, you will be able to use the platform and all its features for free.

If you choose to charge fees, we will charge a “platform share” of 15% of your revenue from host fees. For example, if a Collective you host raises $1,000 and you charge a 10% fee ($100), we will charge you for 15% of that fee ($15).

This charge enables us to maintain the platform, deliver support, and develop new features.&#x20;

You can read more about Platform Share here on our [Platform Settlement](../fiscal-hosts/platform-settlements.md) page.

### Fees on Donations

**Platform Tips = Pay-What-You-Want**

When a person or company contributes to a Collective on our platform, we offer the option to add a “platform tip.”

This tip goes to the Open Collective platform and helps us provide the services and improvements necessary to keep our collective ecosystem thriving.

The amount you give, if anything, is totally up to you.
