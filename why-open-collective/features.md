# Features

**We offer the tools for people and organizations to build a collective future.**

Open Collective is a platform that makes it possible to do things differently. So what makes it special?

**Simple to get started**

Whether you’re starting a Collective, running a Fiscal Host, or contributing to a project, we make [getting started](broken-reference) as simple as possible.

On Open Collective, [Collectives ](../collectives/collectives.md)can focus on their mission without worrying about legal incorporation, taxes, or administration. [Fiscal Hosts](../fiscal-hosts/fiscal-hosts.md) can manage Collectives with our suite of easy-to-use administrative tools. Contributors can offer help or money safely and securely.



**Transparent budgets**

When you’re building together, honesty and openness are vital. [We offer fully transparent budgets](../collectives/managing-money/budgets.md), so everyone can see how money is being raised and spent, building trust within your community.&#x20;

This isn’t just a feature. It’s how we work. That’s why even our code is open source.



**Stress-free management tools**

We want to make sure you can keep track of everything, quickly and simply. Our management tools allow you to get an [overview of budgets](../collectives/managing-money/budgets.md), [build your team](../getting-started/adding-and-removing-team-members.md), and [engage your community](../advanced/keeping-your-community-updated/).

And we’re constantly introducing new ideas to make the process easier.

\
\
**Move money quickly**\
\
[Pay invoices and reimbursements quickly and safely](../fiscal-hosts/expense-payment/). Open Collective integrates with multiple providers to support payments in all non-sanctioned territories and includes its own [AML and anti-fraud features to help identify risky payments.](../fiscal-hosts/expense-payment/understanding-security-checks.md)



**Spread the word and discover others**

Open Collective isn’t just a platform. It’s a community. [We give you a page where you can tell the world about your project, raise money, and gather support.](../collectives/raising-money/) You can also find and connect with other Collectives building near you or those with a shared mission.



**Designed for ongoing collaborations**

We give your supporters the freedom to provide in the way they want. We offer the option to contribute on a one-time or recurring basis so that initiatives can plan better for the future.

We also accept donations from [companies](../giving-to-collectives/giving-as-a-company/) and individuals.



**Build your community**

We help you make sure your community feels valued. Set up [tiers ](../collectives/raising-money/setting-goals-and-tiers.md)and rewards to recognize your supporters, and create [events ](../collectives/events.md)to bring them together.

Use our [Updates](../advanced/keeping-your-community-updated/) feature to let them know how you’re growing, and [Conversations ](../advanced/keeping-your-community-updated/conversations.md)to communicate directly with your community.



**Raise money for something special**

With our [Projects ](../collectives/managing-money/projects.md)feature, you can invite your community to give money to a specific cause or event. Projects have the same transparent budgets, tiers, and goals as collective budgets, and you can update everyone on their progress.



**Get Reports on your Support**

Whether you’re running a Collective or giving to one, [we offer downloadable summaries of all you’ve achieved](../advanced/exporting-your-data.md).

Get a breakdown of your group’s activity or fundraising progress. Or receive a tax-friendly breakdown of all your donations for the month.



**Safe and secure**

[We take security seriously](../advanced/security-for-accounts/). We don’t store credit card numbers and offer passwordless authentication to remove the risk of unsafe passwords.

We also support two-factor authentication and offer the option for [Fiscal Hosts to require all admins to use it](../fiscal-hosts/setting-up-a-fiscal-host/fiscal-host-security-old.md#enforce-2fa-for-all-admins) for essential actions, such as logging in and paying expenses.
