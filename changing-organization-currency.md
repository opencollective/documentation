# Changing Organization Currency

* If there are no transactions associated with your organization, Contact Open Collective to change the currency of your Fiscal Host or Independent Collective
* Collectives must have the same currency as their Fiscal Host.&#x20;
* If the organization already has transactions, you will need to:
  * Turn off fiscal hosting
  * Change your currency within Stripe&#x20;
  * Re-enable fiscal hosting
  * When Stripe is reconnected, the currency of the fiscal host will automatically be changed to the default Stripe currency, so it is very important that the currency is correct within Stripe
