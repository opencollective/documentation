# Integrations

### Webhooks (generic, Slack, Discord) <a href="#webhooks-generic-slack-discord" id="webhooks-generic-slack-discord"></a>

Go to your settings, click on "Webhooks" then select the type and enter the URL for your webhook. The system will automatically detect Slack or [Discord's slack-compatible](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook#execute-slackcompatible-webhook) webhook URLs and will adapt the payloads for them.

See [this link](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks#getting_started) to learn how to create a Slack web-hook, or [this link](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Utiliser-les-Webhooks) to learn how to create a Discord web-hook.

While creating the web-hook, you'll be able (in some cases) to preview the payload by clicking on the Info icon next to the activity name:
