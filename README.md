# Welcome

Welcome to the Open Collective Documentation.\
\
Here, you’ll find guides and technical information to help you make the most of the Open Collective platform.

### What is Open Collective?

> _The Future is Collective. And Open Collective provides a simple and open way to get there._

\
[**Start a project**](https://opencollective.com/create)\
Starting your own collaborative group can be frustrating. You may need to obtain legal status, set up a bank account, and work out how to raise and spend your money fairly.

Through our platform, Open Collective allows any community to collect, manage, and disburse money transparently.\
\
Open Collective also provides access to a network of "Fiscal Hosts".  Fiscal Hosts hold your money in their bank account and handle taxes, accounting, and other financial administration. They also enable you to collect and spend money without needing to form a formal legal entity.\
\
[**Support a project**\
](https://opencollective.com/search)Open Collective is also the place to discover other collectives, support their work, and engage with the community through updates, conversations, and events.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Thousands of groups use Open Collective; find a collective to support with our [Discover Tool](https://discover.opencollective.com/).&#x20;
