# Editing your Profile Page

When you set up an account, you'll be given a profile page that tells people a little bit about you and your activity on the platform.

This is automatically created. Navigate to your Dashboard > Settings > Info to add and change basic information.

This page will include your:

* Display name&#x20;
* Your short description&#x20;
* An avatar&#x20;
* Your cover image

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also edit your info for your Collective, Fiscal Host, or Independent Collective similarly.
{% endhint %}

### Adding images to your profile

**Avatar/Logo**

Hover over your Avatar image while on your profile page. Click Edit Logo/Avatar to upload or change a picture (or drag an image file onto the area)

{% hint style="success" %}
All logos are displayed on a white background, so logos that are already white will not be visible. If you want to use a white logo, upload an image with a colored background instead of a transparent one.
{% endhint %}

**Cover Image**

You can edit your cover image by clicking “Edit Cover” in the top right corner of your profile page, then selecting and adjusting the image of your choice. By clicking on the picture, you can move it around. You can also zoom in and out. The optimum size for a cover image is 2736 x 650.

**Main Color**

You can also “edit main color” to change the color of the main buttons on screen. Pick a preset color or use a custom one.

Your main color determines the color of links and buttons, tier cards, and the hero header if no image is set.
