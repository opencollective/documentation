# Tracking an Expense

Whether you’re submitting an expense or paying it, you can use our platform to track the status of an expense and who’s responsible for the next steps.

Below are the various stages an expense may go through, and what they mean:



**Draft:** The expense submitter has been sent a partially completed expense to fill in, but the expense submitter has not yet completed or submitted it. After 30 days, this draft will expire. \


**Unverified:** The expense submitter has submitted their expense, but has not yet verified their email. They need to do this before it can move to the next step.\


**Pending:** The expense has now been submitted to the Collective. The Collective admin now has the ability to review and approve it. The submitter can also delete or edit the expense to make amendments.\


**Approved:** The Collective admin has approved the expense, the Collective has sufficient funds to pay, and the Fiscal Host admin now has the ability to review and pay it.



**Rejected:** The expense has been rejected by either the Collective or Fiscal Host admin.\


**Spam:** Once an expense has been rejected, it can also be marked as spam. The expense submitter will no longer be able to submit expenses to this Collective.\


**Incomplete:** The Fiscal Host admin has asked the expense submitter for more information.&#x20;



**On hold:** The Fiscal Host is looking into the expense, either by consulting with experts or carrying out research.&#x20;

\
**Scheduled for Pay:** The payment has been scheduled to be paid. Usually, this status applies to payments made via PayPal. \


**Processing:** The expense is in the process of being paid by a third-party provider.

\
**Error:** Something went wrong with the processing of the expense. The Fiscal Host will now try again, reject the expense, or ask the expense submitter for more information. \
\
**Ready to Pay:** The expense is ready to be paid, this status is only visible to admins able to make payments.\
\
**Cancelled:** The payment has been processed, but there has been a problem with the payment. The payer (usually your host) will need to investigate.  \


**Paid:** The expense has been confirmed as paid.
