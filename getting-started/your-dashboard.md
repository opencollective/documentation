# Your Dashboard

When you log in to your account, you will automatically be directed to your Open Collective Dashboard.

The Dashboard is a space that helps you complete all your tasks on Open Collective, whether you’re acting as an individual or an admin of a larger group.

### Navigating your Dashboard

When you first arrive, your Dashboard will be set to your personal account. This will show you a range of tasks that you can perform with this account.

These include:

* Searching recent activity relating to your account&#x20;
* Viewing and tracking the expenses you have submitted&#x20;
* Viewing the contributions you have made on the platform&#x20;
* Changing your account settings, such as your email address, security info, and so on

You can receive updates on specific Collectives and Fiscal Hosts by navigating to their page and clicking Follow under their name.&#x20;

You can review the latest updates from the Open Collective platform by clicking the megaphone in the top-right of the page, next to the search bar.&#x20;

Suppose you have been invited to be a team member or admin of a Collective, Organization, or Fiscal Host. In that case, you will receive a notification on your Dashboard when you are logged in, under your profile.
{% endhint %}

You can also click your profile photo in the top right corner to bring up additional account settings, including:

* Viewing your profile&#x20;
* Selecting preview features&#x20;
* Navigating the Open Collective homepage, docs, or support pages

### Switching between profiles

If you click on the account switcher in the top left menu with your "personal account” profile image on it, you will find a list of all the roles you hold on Open Collective (if any).

This allows you to switch your Dashboard to other roles, such as:

* An admin of a Collective&#x20;
* An admin of an Organization&#x20;
* An admin of a Fiscal Host

This will change the menu to show options that are relevant to the tasks you need to do in those roles.
