# Customizing your Page Layout

Your profile page will show people what you do, how they can back your cause, and allow them to see your latest news and updates.

We’ve made the page customizable so you can showcase your most important information. Navigate to your Dashboard > Public Profile to change what is shown and in what order.

### Hiding and showing sections

There are several different sections that you can include on your page. These can all be made visible or disabled, except for the budget section, which is always visible. The options here can vary depending on whether you are an organization, a Fiscal Host, or a Collective.

Disabling a section does not delete the information in it. It only hides it, and it can be shown again by switching it to “always visible”.

However, to edit the content within a section, you need to make it visible first.

### Available sections

In your profile page settings, you’ll see a range of sections that you can select and reorder as you wish.

Pick the ones that help you to achieve your goals, and give people a sense of exactly how they can support you.

You can also change the order in which they appear by clicking and holding the “dot grid” icon to the left of the section name.

If a section such as “About” or “Updates” does not contain any content, it will not be displayed.
