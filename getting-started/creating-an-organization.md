# Creating an Organization

If you want to contribute as an individual or submit expenses on Open Collective, you can simply use your personal profile.

If you want to act on behalf of a company, you should set up an organization account.

### Why become an organization?

We created organization accounts to allow companies and entities to contribute on Open Collective, in the same way that individuals do.

By setting up as an Organization, you can:

* Contribute to collectives as your company, rather than as an individual
* Manage your account with multiple admins/team members
* Keep track of giving on behalf of your company, even if itâ€™s by multiple people
* Generate receipts for tax purposes
* Issue gift cards to your employees so they can give to causes they care about

### Creating an organization

First you need to set up an individual profile, which you can do by following the steps on our [Setting up an Account](setting-up-your-account.md) page.

Then click on profile switcher, which is located to the left on your dashboard. You should see My Organizations within the drop down menu.

Click on the + button. You can then fill in your details on the "Create Organization" page.

Once your organization is set up, you can toggle between your personal, Collective and/or Organization profiles with the profile switcher.\
