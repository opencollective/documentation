# Adding and Removing Team Members

An organization works best when you work together. Build your team on Open Collective, and select the level of access you want each member to have.

### Roles on Open Collective

**Admin:** Admins can manage all aspects of the Open Collective page, from editing settings to approving expenses. They will also be notified about recent activity, such as new incoming expenses.

**Core Contributors:** A core contributor is shown as part of your team on your Open Collective page. However, they do not have admin access to your organization or Collective on the platform. They cannot access emails, and do not receive notifications. They also cannot access guest lists or purchaser lists for event tickets.

**Accountants:** Accountants are able to see non-public data required for record-keeping, such as uploaded files and reports. However, they cannot make changes, and are not shown as part of your team.

**Community managers:** Community managers can post updates and moderate comments. They are shown as part of the team on your page, but do not have admin access to finances.

If you are a Collective that wants to set up an Event or Project, you can add team members to these without giving them the same status in the Collective itself. See [Projects](../collectives/managing-money/projects.md) or [Events](../collectives/events.md) for more information.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Adding, removing, and editing team members

You can change your team members by navigating to your Dashboard > Team.&#x20;

#### **Add a team member**

Click "Invite Team Member."

You can search for an Open Collective account holder by typing their name in the User Field, or click 'Invite New User' to invite them to sign up for the platform. This will ask you for an email address and their full name.

You should also set their role and add a brief description of their title, responsibilities, or background.

You can also set the date that they joined the Open Collective page.&#x20;

Once you click “save”, the selected team member will receive an invitation to accept or sign up for Open Collective. They will not be listed publicly until they accept and will be shown as “pending” on your team view.

{% hint style="info" %}
**If your team member does not receive an invitation…**\


First, ask them to search for the words “invitation to join” in their inbox, and then check their spam folder.

If the email cannot be found, remove them from the team page and then re-add them. Make sure you select “save” when you’ve filled in their details.\
\
If you are still not successful, please [reach out to our team](https://opencollective.com/contact).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### Editing and removing team members

If you wish to change any team member’s details or level of access, you should click the “pencil icon” button to the top right of their profile picture.

This will also give you the option to remove them if required.\
