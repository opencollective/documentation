# Editing an Expense

Sometimes you may need to edit or delete an expense after you have submitted it..

This may be because:

* You have discovered a mistake and need to correct it.
* You have been asked to change your expense or supply more information by a Collective or Fiscal Host admin.
* You wish to delete your expense.&#x20;

## **Changing your expense details**

If you need to change the information on your expense, first make sure you are logged in, then navigate to either the “expenses” area on your Personal Dashboard, the budget section on the Collective which you submitted the expense or to your profile page.\
\
Locate the desired expense and click on the title to open the dedicated expense page. You will then see edit icons on the various expense components.&#x20;

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If your expense has already been approved by an admin, it may need to be re-approved if you make edits to your expense.

For example, if a Fiscal Host admin contacts you to ask for changes or additional information to be added to your expense, the Collective may need to check it again once edits have been made. This is to ensure that admins have approved the details of every expense before it is paid.

## **Expense comments**

If a Collective or Fiscal Host admin has a question about your expense, they may choose to send you a comment.

These comments are only visible to the expense submitter and the Collective and Fiscal Host admins, as they may contain private information.

Expense comments can be used for a variety of reasons, including:

* Asking for clarification or more information about an expense
* Asking for a receipt, invoice or tax information
* Updating on the status of an expense, if there has been a delay in payment
* Adding comments that do not require action, such as thanks for work completed

## Incomplete expense

If a Collective and/or Fiscal Host admin requires more information from you about your expense, it may be marked as "incomplete".

If you notice that an invoice you are tracking has that status, check your emails and notifications for any comments or questions from admins, and provide this information as soon as possible.

If an admin does not receive the information required, the invoice may remain "incomplete" or be "rejected". This means your expense will not be paid.

## Deleting your expense

If you have submitted an expense to a Collective, and no longer wish to do so, you can choose to delete it by:

1. Ensure you are logged in.&#x20;
2. Finding your expense in your Personal Dashboard or on the Collective's budget page.
3. Click on the Expense Title to open the dedicated expense page.&#x20;
4. Finding the 'More actions' button in the bottom left hand corner.&#x20;
5. Selecting "Delete"

This will delete the expense and it will not be processed.
