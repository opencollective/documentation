# Payment Processor Fees

{% hint style="danger" %}
We have no control over the fees that are charged by payment processors, and they can change without notice. On this page, we provide approximations of how they are calculated as of the date of writing; however, for the most up-to-date information, you should check with the relevant payment processor directly.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Payment processor fees can vary depending on the method of payout, the location/currency of the payee, and the amount of the transaction.

The most cost-effective method is Bank Transfer ACH (USD to USD), which is generally .39 cents. With a bank transfer from USD to another currency, we default to Wise's fee structure on this and they vary depending on the country. More info is available[ here](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/fiscal-hosts/payouts/payouts-with-transferwise#fees).

PayPal's fees are the hardest to predict. In general, if you use PayPal to send USD to a USD account, this will be cheaper than USD to any other currency. PayPal fees vary by country and amount because they charge based on the percentage of the transaction total. More info on PayPal fees[ here](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/fiscal-hosts/payouts/payouts-with-paypal#fees).

Payment processors charge varying amounts for the use of their services. We have no role in setting what these fees are and it is your responsibility to check the terms and conditions of using each payment processor  before deciding which to use for your transactions.
