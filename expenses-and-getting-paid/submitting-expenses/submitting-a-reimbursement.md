# Submitting a Reimbursement

We offer the option to submit a reimbursement to an Organization or Collective. This applies when you have already bought something and want to be paid back.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To avoid disappointment, we advise that you get confirmation in advance from the Organization or Collective on whether they are willing to pay you back for a purchase.

Different Collectives have different policies on what they are willing to reimburse, including travel expenses, meals, equipment, and so on. This may be outlined in their expense policy, but we recommend talking to them directly.
{% endhint %}

The process for submitting a reimbursement is similar to [submitting an invoice](./). You select who is paying, who is getting paid, add your bank details, and any other information about the expense, including the public expense title.

The main difference is that you will also be asked to submit a receipt for each reimbursement.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Expenses will not be paid without a valid receipt including:

* The name of the vendor you paid (i.e. the person or company)
* The date the transaction took place
* A clear description of what you purchased
* The amount you paid
* The form of payment you used (i.e. cash, check, or the last four digits of your card)
{% endhint %}

You should upload the receipt in the box provided or select it from your computer.\
\
We recommend filling in the description of the expense and including information that you think is relevant to help the admins process it.\
\
For example: "Lunch with a client during Funding the Commons conference (September 2023)".

{% hint style="info" %}
While the expense title, the amount, and your Display Name will be shown publicly on the Collective's budget, attached receipts, descriptions, and payment details will only be visible to admins.
{% endhint %}

If you wish to submit multiple receipts, you can do so by clicking "Add New Receipt".

Once you have done this, you will be asked to review your details before submitting.
