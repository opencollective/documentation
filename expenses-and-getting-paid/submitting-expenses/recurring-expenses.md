# Recurring Expenses

## Create a recurring expense

You can set an expense to automatically recur on a periodic basis at the end of the expense submission flow in the Expense Summary.

Select the desired **Frequency** and an (optional) **End Date**.

* Weekly&#x20;
* Monthly&#x20;
* Quarterly&#x20;
* Yearly&#x20;

After the period of time selected has passed, a new draft expense will be created and the author will be notified to review, complete and submit the expense.

{% hint style="info" %}
Draft expenses are based on the previous Expense submitted. Each edit made to the previous expenses will persist to the next.
{% endhint %}

It is also possible to set an End Date for this recurring expense, which can be useful for setting up reminders for pre-defined contracts.

While editing a new draft, you'll also see a banner displaying information about the recurring nature of the expense.

## Cancel a recurring expense

You can also cancel any recurring expense, just click on Edit details in the recurring expense information banner and later, click on the Cancel Recurring Expense button. This draft is now deleted and you'll no longer receive recurring drafts for this expense.
