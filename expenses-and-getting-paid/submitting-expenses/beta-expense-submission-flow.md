# Beta Expense Submission Flow

Over the past few cycles, we have been working towards upgrading and integrating a New Expense Submission flow into the [Dashboard](https://documentation.opencollective.com/getting-started/your-dashboard). We have tested and trialed our work and are ready to gather user feedback.

## Enable the Feature

To activate the public beta, navigate to your profile image in the top right-hand corner of the platform and find "[Preview features](https://documentation.opencollective.com/getting-started/preview-features).‚Äù

Once you have successfully submitted your expense, a pop-up will be displayed if you wish to provide us with feedback; otherwise, please comment below or on [Discord](https://discord.opencollective.com/).&#x20;
