# Getting Paid through Wise

When you are filling in an invoice and do not see your currency as an option for payment, this is likely because banking regulations prevent a transfer of funds between the country your bank is in and the bank of the collective that is paying you. If this happens, you might be able to use Wise to transfer funds.

### Getting paid with Wise

1. The payee needs to open a currency account with Wise ([instructions here](https://wise.com/help/articles/2897234/how-do-i-open-a-currency-account)). It would be best to create an account in the country's currency you are expecting payment in. For example, if you are expecting payment from a collective hosted by OSC or OCF, create a US account to be paid in USD.
2. You will need to follow the Wise process to verify your account. Once verified you will be able to see your account details.
3. Use  Account information from your Wise account in the Open Collective payout method to receive payment to your Wise account using a bank transfer.

Use the ‘Local bank account’ option for a US to US-based transfer. \
Use SWIFT if the transfer is to an international-based bank account.
