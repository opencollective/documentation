# Closing a Fiscal Host

Before closing your Fiscal Host, you will need to zero the Fiscal Host’s balance (including any Projects or Events).  [You can do so by following the instructions for zeroing a Collective's balance.](../collectives/closing-a-collective/zero-collective-balance.md) You will also need to ensure that any outstanding expenses are paid. See our documentation on [Spending Money](../collectives/spending-money/) for more information.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Fiscal Hosts with any recorded transactions can only be archived, not deleted.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Archiving a Fiscal Host

If you have any transactions, you will need to archive your Fiscal Host.

This will prevent new donations (including recurring and expenses), but the Fiscal Host's financial history will remain visible.

To archive your Fiscal Host, navigate to your Fiscal Host’s Dashboard > Settings > Advanced, then click “Archive this Organization.”&#x20;

If you want to activate your Fiscal Host again at a later date, navigate to the same “Advanced” page and find the “Unarchive This Organization” option. This will make your Fiscal Host visible to others again.

### Deleting a Fiscal Host

You can only delete a Fiscal Host if it has no history of transactions or financial activity.

Deleting it will remove all data, including membership and payment methods.

To delete your Fiscal Host, navigate to your Fiscal Host's Dashboard > Settings > Advanced, then click “Delete this Organization.”&#x20;
