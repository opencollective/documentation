# Funds

## Funds

Funds are similar to an organization in that both will let you donate to a Collective, but funds are designed to hold and display a balance, show transaction history, and distribute money through Grants and Expenses.

If you are more focused on disbursing funds than receiving them, a **Fund** may be a good fit for you.

{% hint style="success" %}
Funds allow you to know how much money the Fund has, approve or invite grant requests, and easily request disbursements from your charitable Fund.
{% endhint %}

**Funds** provide:

* Transparent financial management on the Open Collective platform
* A streamlined, single-payer process for supporters
* Support for communities operating on Open Collective or elsewhere
* A lightweight 'Request a Grant' process for projects to issue money to grant recipients
* More flexibility with what you choose to publicly show (in terms of expense management)
  * Protect the identities of those receiving grants
    * e.g. emergency relief aid may not want to be as public
      * Will still be reported and available to the Fiscal Host



By navigating to your Fiscal Host Dashboard > Funds & Grants > Hosted Funds, you can see all of the funds that your Fiscal Host currently hosts, create new Funds, manage your existing Funds, and export information about the Funds that you are hosting.&#x20;

On this Hosted Funds Dashboard, the main view is a list of all of your currently hosted Funds. You can quickly search for a specific Fund by using the Search bar above the list of Funds. All of the Funds on this list have the following properties:

* Fund name
* Team&#x20;
* Fee&#x20;
* Hosted Since
* Total Raised
* Total Disbursed
* Current Balance

## Manage Funds

Once your Fund is created, you can manage it by finding it in your list of Funds and clicking on the specific entry that you would like to view or edit. Once selected, you are able to view associated information and alter settings.

### Overview

From this view, you can see the Fund's name, the date that it has been hosted since, its current balance, and its associated team members. You can also view a short list of its most recent transactions, as well as the most recent activities associated with it. While the lists present on this page feature only a few entries, there are buttons to "View Transactions," and "View Activities" that will allow you to browse all of the respective information.&#x20;

### Settings

From this page, you can easily alter a few key settings for a Fund.&#x20;

* **Fee Structure:** Allows you to select whether you would like for the Fund to use the default host fee set by your Fiscal Host, or set a custom host fee.
* **Expense Types:** Allows you to select whether a Fund will use the default settings for the Fiscal Host for expense types, or manually choose if a Fund allows for Invoices, Reimbursements, or Grants.
* **Payout Method Details:** Allows you to select whether Fund Admins are able to see the payout method details of payees.

### More Actions

On the Fund page, there is a button for "More Actions." Clicking this button will give you access to the following additional options:

* View Transactions
* View Disbursed Grants
* View Grant Requests
* Add Funds
* Create Grant Requests
* Add Expense
* Add [Agreement](../managing-your-collectives/agreements.md)
* Contact
* [Freeze](../managing-your-collectives/freezing-a-collective.md) Fund
* Unhost

{% hint style="info" %}
All of these actions are also accessible by clicking on the Three Dot Menu button next to the specific Fund from the Hosted Funds list.
{% endhint %}

## Exporting Fund Information

You can export information about your Funds by clicking the Export CSV button in the top right corner of the Hosted Funds page. You can either use the default export settings, or you can configure your export with dozens of fields across the following four categories:

* **About:** This includes fields like Name, Status, and Currency.
* **Financials:** This includes fields like Balance, Total Spent (All Time), and Average Yearly Received.
* **Contributions:** This includes fields like Last Contribution Date, Total Refunded Value, and Number of Contributions.&#x20;
* **Expenses:** This includes fields like First Expense Date, Distinct Payess, and Max Expense Value.

To create a new export template using these fields, click the dropdown under "Selected export set," and click "New preset."

Once you have configured the export to include your necessary specific fields, you can download a smaller sample to test if the export meets your needs by clicking "Export Sample."
