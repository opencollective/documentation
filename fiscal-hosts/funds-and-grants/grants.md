# Grants

By navigating to your Fiscal Host Dashboard > Funds & Grants > Grants, you can see all of the Grants that are associated with your Fiscal Host and manage existing Grants.

On this Grants Dashboard, the main view is a list of all Grants associated with your Fiscal Host. This does not just include Grants that have already been approved or disbursed, but all Grants that have been created, including those that have been rejected, marked as spam, placed on hold, etc. You can quickly search for a specific Grant by using the Search bar above the list of Grants. All of the Grants on this list have the following properties:

* Fund
* Beneficiary
* Date
* Amount
* Status

## Manage Grant

Once a Grant is created, you can manage it by finding it in your list of Grants and clicking on the specific entry that you would like to view or edit. Once selected, you are able to view associated information and leave comments.

From this view, you can see important information about a Grant such as:

* Name of Grant
* Grant Number
* Category
* Tags
* Grant Submitter
* Status
* Grant Description

At the bottom right of the page, there is a shield icon. By clicking it, you can also view the [Security Checks](../expense-payment/understanding-security-checks.md) associated with the specific Grant.



### More Actions

At the bottom left of the page, there is a dropdown button for More Actions. By clicking it, you will get access to the following options:

* Approve
* Reject
* Copy Link
* View Transactions



Alternatively, rather than clicking on a Grant to view all of its details, you can click on the Three Dot Menu associated with the specific Grant in the full Grant list. This will provide you with the following options:

* View Details
* View Previous Grants
* Approve Grant
* Reject Grant
