# Funds and Grants

## Funds

Funds are similar to an organization in that both will let you donate to a Collective. However, Funds are designed to hold and display a balance, show transaction history, and distribute money through Grants and Expenses.

If you are more focused on disbursing funds than receiving them, a Fund may be a good fit for you.

## Grants

Grants are similar to expenses in that they are disbursements. However, Grants are typically associated with a specific Fund or Collective that are giving money to eligible groups or individuals.
