# PayPal

We offer PayPal as an option to receive money for your collectives. In order to activate PayPal for your collectives please [contact us](https://opencollective.com/contact).&#x20;

Once we have enabled PayPal for your host, in order to connect your business PayPal account to Open Collective, you will need to go through the following steps.

1.  Create a new PayPal app

    * Open [PayPal's Developer](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/applications/) page and Log In.
    * In _My Apps & Credentials_ page, select the **Live** environment, and click in _Create app_.
