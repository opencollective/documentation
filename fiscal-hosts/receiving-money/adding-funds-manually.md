# Adding Funds Manually

You can manually add funds to a Collective. This is useful when you have received a contribution for a Collective outside the Open Collective platform (via bank transfer, Patreon, Eventbrite, or another service) and want to apply it to a Collective's budget.&#x20;

1. Navigate to your Fiscal Host Dashboard > Collectives > Hosted Collectives
2. Use the search bar to find the Collective you want to add funds to
3. Click on the three dots > Add funds \


Fill the form with all required information to add the funds to that Collective with the following information:

* The **source** of the funds. It can be your Fiscal Host, another Collective, an Organization or a [Vendor](../managing-your-collectives/vendors.md).
* The **tier** to which the donation applies (if any)
* A **short description** of the funds.
* The **date** the funds were accepted.
* An **internal memo** used by other host administrators.
* The **amount of funds** you want to send to a Collective.
* Your **host fee**, which is the fee you charge your Collectives. It's already set to your default, but you can change it to a one-time fee of your preference.
* A **payment processor fee**

Once you're done, just click on Add Funds.

## Internal Memos

Internal memos are used to indicate, to yourself and other administrators, anything of note regarding this transaction. Typically, this will be some information about the source, the provision of funds, or any stipulations under which the funds were provided. For instance:

* A purchase order or invoice number
* A check number or bank transaction identifier
* A grant application and associated award

The memo will appear to any administrator under 'view details on the transaction list.
