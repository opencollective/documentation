# Bank Transfers

Hosts can set up manual bank transfers in order to receive money directly in their bank accounts (via bank transfer).&#x20;

You can enable manual bank transfers by completing the following instructions:

1. Navigate to your Fiscal Host Dashboard > Settings > Receiving Money
2. Under Bank Transfers, click “Set bank details”
3. Follow the directions on the page to add in your bank account information and instructions that will be emailed to contributors when they initiate a manual bank payment.&#x20;

Financial Contributors will then be able to select the 'Bank Transfer' option as a payment method. After completing the donation, they will automatically be emailed the instructions you specified outlining how to manually complete the transaction, this includes a unique transaction identifier.&#x20;

They then proceed to make the payment, using the code as a reference.

This transaction shows up in the Expected Funds section in your Dashboard. It shows the amount, the contributor, and the unique ID code (order#).

Once the money has been received in the Host's bank account, an admin of the Host will be able to match the transactions, mark as completed and the funds will be added to the collective's budget and the contributor will automatically receive a receipt by email.&#x20;

If a pending transfer is cancelled, click ‘Mark as expired” to remove it from the expected funds list. Otherwise it will automatically expire after two months. \
