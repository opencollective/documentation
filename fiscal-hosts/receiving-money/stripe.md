# Stripe

Once Stripe has been connected successfully, financial contributors can donate via credit or debit card, SEPA, ACH direct debit, Apple Pay and Google Pay. The money will flow through to your bank account via Stripe and Open Collective will automatically process these transactions and credit the amount to the correct balance on the platform.

How to connect to Stripe:

1. Go to your Fiscal Host Dashboard > Settings > Receiving Money
2. Click “Connect Stripe”
3. Select the account you'd like to connect. You will need to be an admin of this account
4. Stripe will guide you through their connection process&#x20;

Make sure your Stripe account is correctly configured to make live charges. Without this contributors will not be able to make payments.&#x20;
