# Fiscal Host Security (Old)

Fiscal Hosts can opt-in to enforce 2FA for all of their admins. Any attempt at triggering admin operations or visiting the admin pages will be blocked until the admins enable 2FA on their profiles. A rolling payout limit can also be set so that 2FA is triggered when this limit is met.

Projects and events inherit the 2FA settings from their parents.

Access your security settings by navigating to your Fiscal Host Dashboard > Settings > Security. From here, you can set your two-factor authentication requirements for your Fiscal Host admins.&#x20;

### Enforce 2FA for all admins&#x20;

Information on how to enable this feature is in the [Security for Accounts](../../advanced/security-for-accounts/) section.

### Rolling Payouts&#x20;

Admins will be asked to authenticate with 2FA authentication when they make their first payment and again once theyâ€™ve hit the rolling limit.
