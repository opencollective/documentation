# Creating a Fiscal Host

You can set up a Fiscal Host on Open Collective in just a few steps. However, this process can vary, based on your aims and what you're already doing on Open Collective.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember, you will need to be established as a legal entity in your country of operation to become a Fiscal Host. Check your local regulations to find out how to do this.
{% endhint %}



**Step One: Create an Open Collective account**

You will need an individual Open Collective account to start the process of creating a Fiscal Host. Visit the [Setting up an Account](../../getting-started/setting-up-your-account.md) page for information on how to do this.



**Step Two: Create an Organization**

The next step is to create an Organization. In your account profile menu, go to the "My Organizations" section and find the "+" button. For more information on Organizations, go to the [Creating an Organization page](../../getting-started/creating-an-organization.md)



**Step Three: Transform your Organization into a Fiscal Host**

Go to your Organizationâ€™s Dashboard > Settings > Advanced. You should now have the option to "Activate as Host".&#x20;

You will then be able to fill in all the details of your Fiscal Host, including your information, host fees, and so on.



**Step Four: Get set up to receive money**

For you to be able to receive money from Collectives, you will need to configure a few settings. You can find the instructions for doing so on our [Receiving Money as a Host page](../receiving-money/).

### I want to set up a Collective and a Fiscal Host at the same time

If you wish to set up both a Collective and a Fiscal Host:

1. Set up your individual Open Collective account as in Step One.
2. Go to your account profile menu, find the "My Collectives" section, and click "+".
3. Follow the instructions to [set up a Collective](../../collectives/creating-a-collective/).
4. When you're asked to add a Fiscal Host, select the Start Accepting Contributions option.
5. When asked who will hold the money, choose Our Organization.
6. You can then choose to add an existing Organization as a Fiscal Host, or create a new one.
7. You will need to connect a Stripe account or bank account to start receiving contributions.

### I want to leave my current Fiscal Host and set one up myself

If you feel you wish to host your own Collective, you have two options:

\
**Set up your Collective as an Independent Collective**

This means you will be in control of all the finances and admin of your Collective, and will need your own legal status and bank account. See our [Independent Collectives](broken-reference) section for more information.

**Set up a Fiscal Host**

This option is most suitable if you want to host multiple Collectives, either now or in the future.

Visit our [Changing Your Fiscal Host](../../collectives/changing-fiscal-host.md) section for more details on transferring your Collective. We recommend contacting your current Fiscal Host directly to arrange the best way to transfer any funds to your new host.
