The Fiscal Host Overview Dashboard provides admins with a high-level overview of their status on the platform. This includes a to-do list of pending Expenses, Contributions, and Applications; a snapshot of balance, income, and spent funds; and a short list of recent activity associated with the Host.

## To do

  * Missing Receipts
  * On Hold
  * Incomplete
  * Errors
* Contributions
  * Disputed
  * In Review
* Applications
  * Unreplied
  * Pending
