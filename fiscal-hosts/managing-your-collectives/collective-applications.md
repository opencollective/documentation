# Collective Applications

When a Collective applies to your Fiscal Host, you will receive a notification in your email and on the platform.

You then have the option to look at their information and decide whether to approve or reject them.

{% hint style="success" %}
If you are the admin of both the applying Collective and the Fiscal Host, your application will automatically be approved.
{% endhint %}

As a Fiscal Host, you are responsible for all the activity that occurs in your bank account. Therefore we recommend that you take care in selecting the Collectives you host, and make any necessary checks before approving applications.

You may also want to set policies on which types of Collectives you wish to host, so that potential applicants know in advance if they are a good fit.

You can also implement measures such as requiring Collectives to have two admins.



**Viewing a pending application**

Pending applications can be found in the "Collectives" section of your Dashboard menu. Make sure your profile is set to your Organization Admin account.\
\
You can find the list of **pending, approved, and rejected Collectives** on the "Applications" page.

You can also sort the applications by **most recent and oldest**.

\
\
When a Collective applies to a Fiscal Host, the admin is encouraged to provide:

* Collective name
* Admins (some hosts ask for a minimum number of admins to ensure stability)
* Purpose
* An application message, sent directly to the host
* Contact email address

You can either make a decision to approve or reject based on the information you have, or contact the applicant for more information.

To do this, click the mail icon next to the Collective that has applied to your host.
