# Viewing your Host Reports

It's important to have a good sense of how your Fiscal Host is performing over time.

This is why we offer a Reports page that gives you a clear picture and helps you plan ahead.

{% hint style="info" %}
To find your host's Reports page:

1. Make sure you are switched to your Fiscal Host Admin account
2. Go to your Fiscal Host Dashboard > Reports
{% endhint %}

\
Your Reports page will allow you to keep track of:

* Your Total Money Managed (ie. The full amount held in your bank account)
* Money raised from Host Fees
* How much has been raised in contributions, and paid in expenses

You can also filter by date, or by Collective.

#### **Exporting your reports**

If you wish to export your data for use elsewhere, you can do so by clicking the "Export CSV" button to the right of the search bar at the top of the page.
