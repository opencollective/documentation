# Hosted Collectives

Open Collective makes it easy to keep track of all the Collectives that you host.

To view a list of all your Hosted Collectives, navigate to your Fiscal Host’s Dashboard > Collectives.

#### Search

Either find the Collective listed on the page or look them up by their name via the search bar.&#x20;

#### Tabs

Utilize the tabs to view all, active, frozen or unhosted Collectives.&#x20;

#### Filters

There are four kinds of filters that you can use to sort your Collectives:

* Using the filters at the top of the page, you can sort by Type. The page is automatically set to show Collectives and Funds, you can customize this to also show projects and events.
* Filter by fee structure: global host fee (the standard fee you set in your settings) or a custom fee.
* Status
* Balance

You can also sort by the period of time you've hosted them - most recent and oldest.



## More Actions

Click on the three dots to view details, view transactions, add funds, add agreements, or contact, freeze, or unhost the Collective.

### View Details

View Details brings up a side view that provides more details about the Collective.

From the Details view, admins can see an overview of how long a Collective has been hosted, its balance, team members, transactions, and activities.

From this view, Admins can also easily change a few key settings for the Collective:&#x20;

* **Fee Structure:** Allow the Collective to pay the default host fee, or set a custom fee structure for this specific Collective
* **Expense Type:** Select what expense types people can submit to this Collective
* **Payout method details:** Enable or disable Collective Admins ability to view sensitive payout method details of payees

#### Expense Types

Use the Global host settings or Enable or Disable Invoices, Reimbursements or Grants for an individual Collective.

#### Set Fee Structure

You will be prompted to either choose your global fee structure or to create a custom fee for this specific Collective.&#x20;

#### Show Payout Method Details

Fiscal Host admins can toggle whether admins of specific Collectives are able to view sensitive payout method details of payees by toggling on the option to "Show payout method details."

## Additional security measures

As an added security and compliance measure for Fiscal Hosts, their Admins can now freeze or unhost a collective. This may be useful for compliance reasons, violations of terms, or if a Collective wants to leave but hasn’t removed the Fiscal Host themselves already.

### Freezing a Collective

Freezing a Collective means temporarily limiting what a Collective (and their connected Projects & Events) can and cannot do on the platform.

Freezing a Collective will block all financial activity within that Collective. They will not be able to accept funds, pay out expenses, post updates, create new Events or Projects, or add new Team members under this Collective. However, they will still continue to receive recurring donations that were started before this freeze.

Contributions and expenses will be removed from the Collective's public profile, and admins will be informed of why the action was taken.

### Unhosting a Collective

We've also added the ability to unhost a Collective, which can be used to free a Collective to choose another host or to become an[ Independent Collective](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/independent-collectives/about-independent-collectives).

* This Fiscal Host will no longer manage money on behalf of the Collective.
* Any active recurring PayPal contributions or Virtual Cards will be cancelled.
* Unhosted Collectives can then apply to a different fiscal host or become an[ Independent Collective](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/independent-collectives/about-independent-collectives).
* When we trigger recurring contributions at the beginning of the month, valid Stripe configurations (through a Fiscal Host or via an Independent Collective) will be charged.
* Stripe recurring contributions can be transferred to a new host. If the collective has a new host, they will continue as usual. If they don't, the contribution will be cancelled.

Before unhosting, a Collective's[ balance must be zeroed](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/collective-settings/zero-collective-balance) by paying expenses, making contributions to other Collectives or gifting the balance to the host.

#### Steps to unhost a Collective (if they want to join another Fiscal Host)

1. The collective will make a one-time donation to their new Fiscal Host in the amount of the balance.
   1. Make sure "The payee is covering the fees" is checked when paying the Expense so the Collective can empty the balance precisely to the cent.
2. The Collective admin will need to update the collective's status on the platform to ‘unhost’ it from their current Fiscal Host.
3. The Collective admin will need to apply to the new Fiscal Host.
4. The new Fiscal Host will add them to their hosted Collectives and reallocate the balance via ‘add funds’ to the Collective.
