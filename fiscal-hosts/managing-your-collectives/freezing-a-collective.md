# Freezing a Collective

It may sometimes be necessary to temporarily suspend a Collective's activity for a variety of reasons.

This measure can be used to freeze funds during an investigation or a dispute between internal admins. A host may also decide to do this if funds need to be kept in an account to pay for a large expense.

Freezing a Collective can be reversed by the Fiscal Host admin, which restores all activity as before. Or it can be kept in place until the Collective is unhosted.

If you wish to unhost a Collective, check our [Unhosting a Collective page](unhosting-a-collective.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
If a Collective is frozen, it cannot:

* Pay out expenses
* Accept contributions
* Post updates
* Create new Events or Projects
* Add or remove new team members\


However, any recurring contributions that were set up before the freeze will continue to be paid as normal.
{% endhint %}

If a Collective is frozen, the Collective admins will be notified via an email notification. The Collective's page will also no longer display contributions and expenses, and a message will be displayed explaining that "some actions are temporarily limited".



## Freeze a Collective:

1. Make sure you have set your profile to your Fiscal Host Admin account
2. Go to your Fiscal Host Dashboard > Collectives > Hosted Collectives&#x20;
3. Locate the Collective you wish to freeze in your list of hosted Collectives
4. Click on the three dots to the bottom right of the Collective's card (see image)
5. Choose "Freeze"

You can opt to send the Collective admins a message explaining the reasons for this action, and outlining what they may need to do to resolve the situation. This will be sent to them via email but will not be displayed publicly.

## Unfreeze a Collective:

1. Find the card for the Collective you previously froze in your list of Hosted Collectives
2. Click the three dots
3. Select "Unfreeze"
