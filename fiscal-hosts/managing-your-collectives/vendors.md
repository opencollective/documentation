# Vendors

A vendor represents an external entity which Fiscal Hosts can attribute contributions or expenses to. Vendors have no public profile and are only able to be created and edited by Fiscal Host Admins.

Navigate to your Fiscal Host Dashboard and select Vendors.



## Review Existing Vendors

Utilize our potential Vendor tool to transform any past organizations into Vendors and contribute to a cleaner platform.

These are organizations that any admin of your Fiscal Host is also an admin of. These organizations have been used to submit an expense to either your Fiscal Host or any of your Collectives.
