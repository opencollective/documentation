# Collecting Local Taxes

In certain countries or regions, Fiscal Hosts are required to collect local taxesâ€”for example, VAT in the EU and GST in NZ

Please[ contact us](https://opencollective.com/contact) if your hosted Collectives need to charge taxes. We will work with you to conform to your local legislation.



## VAT

{% hint style="info" %}
VAT will only apply if the Collective creates a **service** or **product** tier for events.
{% endhint %}

Once VAT is set up for a Collective, we will ask for the country of residence and an optional VAT number on an as-needed basis. We will apply the VAT rules accordingly:

* Charge VAT from the country of the event, if it's an event
* VAT percentage depends on the country where the Collective is
* Don't charge VAT if a VAT number is provided and the contribution comes from another EU country

### Enable VAT at the host level

If the host is the one supposed to collect VAT (which is the most common case) then you can enable it by going to the Edit section (`https://opencollective.com/HOST_SLUG/admin`) and set your country to a European country. The form will then ask for a VAT number.

Your host is now ready to start accepting VAT. You still need to enable it on a per-collective basis by setting a country and a "VAT setting" for the Collective on the Collective admin page (`https://opencollective.com/COLLECTIVE_SLUG/admin`).

### Enable VAT at the collective level

If the Collective has a VAT number and should be responsible for collecting VAT itself, you can enable that by following the exact same steps as before, except you'll choose the option "Use my own VAT number" on the last step.



## GST (New Zealand)

GST is also supported for New Zealand.[ Contact us](https://opencollective.com/contact)!
