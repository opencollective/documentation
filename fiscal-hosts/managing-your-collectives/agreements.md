# Agreements

Agreements on the Open Collective platform serve as a mechanism for Fiscal Hosts to track information relevant to paying expenses for specific Collectives.&#x20;

If a Fiscal Host has added Agreements for a specific Collective, whenever an expense is submitted related to that Collective, the Fiscal Host will receive an indication that there are agreements in place in case they need to be reviewed before the expense is paid.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When Agreements are added, only admins of the Fiscal Host can see them.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Adding Agreements

Navigate to your Fiscal Host Dashboard > Agreements. Click "Add New +" in the top right corner of the page. On the side page that opens up, you can then fill in the following information:

* **Collective:** Agreements are only assigned to individual Collectives. Select the relevant Collective here.
* **Title:** Collectives can have more than one associated Agreement. Use this title to help distinguish between different Agreements and indicate to your fellow admins the purpose of this Agreement.
* **Agreement file:** Some Agreements are tied to specific documents. If necessary, use this field to upload them to the platform for easy access.
* **Expiration date:** Use this field to indicate if an Agreement is only relevant up to a specific date.&#x20;
* **Notes:** Add any additional information necessary for the specific Agreement. Because the Agreement file is optional, Fiscal Host admins can also use this field alone to define an Agreement if there are no related documents.

Alternatively, you can navigate to your Fiscal Host Dashboard > Hosting > Hosted Collectives and find the specific Collective that you'd like to add an Agreement to. Click on the Collective, and at the bottom of the side page click More Actions > Add Agreement.

## Editing  and Deleting Agreements

Navigate to your Fiscal Host Dashboard > Agreements. Find the specific Agreement that you would like to modify and click on it. On the top right, you will find options to Edit or Delete it.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
When you're on the Agreements Dashboard, you can filter by Collective by clicking the "+ Account" button.

Alternatively, once you have found the specific Agreement you're looking for, you can click the three-dot icon on its line. In the menu that pops up, you can select Edit or Delete.
