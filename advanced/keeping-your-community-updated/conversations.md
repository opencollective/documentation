# Conversations

Conversations are a discussion forum for your Collective, Fiscal Host, or Organization. They are public threads that everyone can read and participate in. Use them to get feedback from your community or to organize your actions!

Conversations are enabled by default. If you would like to disable this option, you can navigate to your Dashboard > Settings > Conversations.&#x20;



## Moderation

As a Collective, Fiscal Host, or Organization admin, you can delete any comment submitted in a conversation. You can also delete a conversation by deleting its root comment.&#x20;

You will receive an email notification when someone replies to a conversation.
