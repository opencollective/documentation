# Viewing Transactions

Browse the Open Collective Ledger with the Dashboard Transactions tool. We have designed it to look and operate similarly to a bank statement.

To view the Transactions page, navigate to your **Dashboard** and then **Transactions**. Utilize the account switcher to switch between accounts.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-05-29 at 4.50.27 PM.png" alt="A screenshot of a user&#x27;s Transaction page within their Dashboard. On the top left, there is the Open Collective logo, a button for Dashboard and a button for Explore. On the top right there is a Search box, an icon for notifications, and the user&#x27;s profile picture. On the left there is the account switcher module, and the full Dashboard list of pages. The majority of the page is the Transactions table, featuring Transactions for a Fiscal Host, a search box, options for adding filters and sorting type, and an Export CSV button."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the transactions table you can see the Date and Time of the transaction, the account, the Recipient/Sender, the Kind of transaction and the Net amount with the Currency.

### **Contextual Transactions**&#x20;

The transactions you see are based on the context in which you are using the tool.

1. If your view is set to your individual account, you will see transactions that are related only to you: expenses you've submitted and contributions you've made.
2. If you are a collective administrator, you will see all the transactions that are related to the collective: all the added funds, contributions made to the collective, expenses submitted to the collective, and payment processor and host fees.
3. If you are a fiscal host administrator, you will see all of your organizational transactions and all the transactions related to the collectives you host.

### **Related transactions**

Hovering over individual transactions will bring up a blue line to the left. This indicates the groupings of transactions.&#x20;

Multiple transactions occur from the initial transaction for example, in the below screenshot:

There is a table with six rows featuring individual transactions, that when viewed together form a transaction group. This group is indicated by a blue line on the left."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Sort&#x20;

Sort the transactions either by Date (Oldest - Newset) or Effective Date (Oldest - Newest)&#x20;

At the top, there is the sort button that shows the current sort method as &#x22;Date.&#x22; Below that we see four sort options split into two categories: the first category is Date featuring &#x22;Oldest to Newest&#x22; and &#x22;Newest to Oldest;&#x22; the second category is Effective Date featuring &#x22;Oldest to Newest&#x22; and &#x22;Newest to Oldest.&#x22;"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Export CSV&#x20;

Head to the [Exporting Transactions](exporting-transactions.md) section to find out more.&#x20;

### Extra features for Fiscal Hosts

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Untitled.png" alt="A screenshot of the transactions page for a Fiscal Host. In the transaction table, the &#x22;Account&#x22; field indicates that some of the transactions are related to the Fiscal Host directly while others are for their hosted Collectives."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Transactions for hosted collectives are included in the 'All' transactions view. You can use the tabs to only view transactions from the hosted Collectives or the Fiscal Host.

We have removed [expected funds](../../fiscal-hosts/receiving-money/expected-funds.md) in this view, but these can be found in the Contributions section.
