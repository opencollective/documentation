# Logging into your Account

Open Collective uses a passwordless system to log you into your account initially. You can choose to set a password after your initial registration and log in with that instead.

**Why Passwordless?**

Passwords don’t always make things more secure. Users frequently reuse passwords or create ones that are easy for fraudsters to guess. Passwords are also more vulnerable to phishing, a type of fraud in which someone tricks you into revealing your password.
{% endhint %}

### How passwordless works&#x20;

Passwordless systems use a “magic link,” which is sent directly to your email. It is a system trusted by companies such as Slack, Monzo, Notion, and Scaleway for its ease and security.

When you type your email into Open Collective's sign-in box, the system will identify you as an existing or new user.

If you have an account, we'll send you an email with a unique link that logs you in to Open Collective. You will stay logged in on that device for 30 days.

If you're a new user, you'll be asked to create an account.

### Setting a password

If you’d prefer to set a password, navigate to your Dashboard > Settings > Security. You will then be asked for your email and password each time you sign in.\
\
If you forget your password, you can reset it or ask for a link to be sent to your email account.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To maintain your security, we recommend using a password manager to set and store passwords you create.
{% endhint %}

### **Two-factor authentication**

You can further improve your account security by enabling Two Factor Authentication (2FA) on your Open Collective account.

If you are managing money on behalf of a community, we highly recommend enabling Two-factor authentication (2FA) on your account. This provides you with an extra layer of security if your password is compromised.
