# Security For Accounts

Security is hugely important to us here at Open Collective. We maintain the highest security practices to make sure that your individual and Collectives information is protected.

We do not store credit card details, so they cannot be lost if our systems are compromised. Any details you supply are secured by Stripe, a provider trusted by many leading companies worldwide. [Learn more](https://stripe.com/docs/security/stripe) about Stripeâ€™s security.

We also invite and pay security researchers to test the resilience of our system and suggest improvements, in line with our security bounty policy. [You can find more information about our security policy on GitHub.](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/security/policy)

If you find an error, don't hesitate to contact our security team at [security@opencollective.com](mailto:security@opencollective.com). Please do not disclose the issue publicly before we have resolved it.
