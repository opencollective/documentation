# Activity Log

On Open Collective, there are a few ways to get an overview of your activity on the platform:

* Recent Activity
* Activity Log

## Recent Activity

If you’d like a quick overview of all of the Expenses and Contributions related to your personal account, and Activities and Updates from the Collectives and Fiscal Hosts that you follow or are an administrator for, navigate to your Personal Dashboard > Overview. On this page, by clicking on the dropdown menu in the top right corner, you can filter the activity by type:

* Expenses
* Contributions
* Activities and Updates

## Activity Log

If you’d like a more comprehisive view of acitivity on the platform of any account that you are an administrator for, you should use the Activity Log in the account’s settings. To access this log, navigate to the Dashboard for whichever account you’d like to see the activity of > Settings > Activity Log.

Once on this page, you will find a complete list of actions on the platform related to the specific account that you are viewing. Options on this page allow you to filter by time period and activity. There are dozens of different activities that you can filter by depending on what type of account you’re viewing; for example, there are over 50 activities that Fiscal Hosts can filter by. These activities are broken down into categories to help you find exactly the activity you’re searching for:

* Host
* Expenses
* Accounts
* Contributions
* Updates & Conversations
* Members
* Virtual Cards
* Gift Cards

If the account that you are viewing is a Fiscal Host, another option for filtering also appears for selecting which account you would like to view activity for. Options that will appear here are “Own account” for activity related to the Fiscal Host itself, “All hosted accounts” for all Collectives that are hosted by the Fiscal Host, all of the individual Collectives that are hosted by the Fiscal Host, and any events that are associated with the Fiscal Host or hosted Collectives. This filter also allows you to type to search for specific Collectives.

When you click on any individual activity, a sidebar will appear that will provide further details about the specific activity.
