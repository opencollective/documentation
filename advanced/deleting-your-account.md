# Deleting your Account

If you wish to remove your account from Open Collective, you can do so by either deleting it or archiving it.

Both of these actions can be found in the “advanced” section in your settings.

### Deleting your account

Open Collective provides transparent and public budgets for all its collectives, _you **cannot** delete your account if you have any history of transactions on the platform_. This includes being paid by or contributing to a collective.

This is to ensure that collectives are able to maintain the integrity and accuracy of their records. In these cases, you will need to archive your account instead, using the steps outlined below.

If you have no activity registered on your account, you can delete your account by navigating to your Dashboard > Settings > Advanced, and clicking Delete This Account.

### Archiving your account

If you have transactions or contributions on your account, you must archive your account instead.

Archived accounts will appear as inactive and no new activity will be allowed. Any subscriptions tied to that account - such as recurring contributions - will be canceled.

To archive your account, navigate to your Dashboard > Settings > Advanced and click Archive This Account.

### **Merging accounts**

If you have set up two or more accounts and wish to merge them rather than delete or archive them, [get in touch with us](https://opencollective.com/help) and we can action this for you.&#x20;
