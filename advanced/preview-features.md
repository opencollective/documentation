# Preview Features

Preview Features lets you test a selection of upcoming features and improvements before they are fully released.

### Activating (and deactivating) Preview Features

To find and choose features:

1. Log in to Open Collective
2. Click on the profile icon in the top-right corner
3. Find the Preview Features option on the menu
4. Select the features you would like to preview, and switch them on using the toggle button

By clicking the button, the feature preview will be enabled on your account. If you want to change back for any reason, toggle the button off again, and your interface will revert to the original state.&#x20;

The features available in the preview features menu will vary depending on the type of role you hold on the platform. For example, admins may see different options to individual users.

### Improving Preview Features

Every feature in the Preview Features menu is at a stage where we're happy to share it with users. They may, however, change without notice as we receive and adapt to user feedback.

We would always like to hear from you about any improvements you’d like to see, but we’re particularly interested in feedback regarding new features and updates.

If you want us to change or fix any part of the feature you're currently previewing, please get in touch via the link in the menu box or contact[ us](https://opencollective.com/contact).
