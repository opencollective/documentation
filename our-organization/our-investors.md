# Our Investors

Open Collective is building something for people who want to work for real change.

To do that, we needed investors who were willing to support us - but allow us to retain our independence.

Since our launch in 2015, we have raised a total of $2,815,000 so far, including:

* $815k in convertible notes in 2015-2016
* A $2M Series Seed in June 2017.

Our investors believe in our mission - so they allow us to focus on real impact over rapid growth, and do not control the platform.

We update our investors annually, in public, [on our blog.](https://blog.opencollective.com/tag/investor-updates) Our latest update [can be found here.](https://blog.opencollective.com/open-collective-2022-investors-update)&#x20;

### Our Strategy for 2023-24

Over the next two years, we aim to prepare Open Collective so that it can become a platform that can scale while maintaining its values.

This will include:

* Building a mature team that’s ready for the future, with clear processes and stronger communications
* Growing based on what makes us different, and discovering what our community wants next
* Co-designing the next phase of our platform with our users and communities&#x20;
* Allow our community to scale by giving hosts the help they need to grow

To find out more about what that means for Open Collective, read our [2023-24 strategy post](https://blog.opencollective.com/oc-strategy-2023-2024).

### Exiting to Community

Often, startups develop to the point where they are acquired by a larger organization, or are listed on the stock market. This is known as an “exit”.

Instead of planning for this, we are actively exploring an “exit to community” - in which our users and community become owners of the platform.

This means that Open Collective would continue to grow, in the interests of those that use and value it.
