# About Open Collective

### What is Open Collective?

Created in 2015, Open Collective is a platform that makes it easy to raise, manage, and disburse money with complete transparency.\
\
Since October 2024, Open Collective has been forked into two different initiatives:

* The classic platform, started in 2015, is now managed by the non-profit [OFi Consortium.](https://oficonsortium.org/)
* A new [web3 platform](https://opencollective.xyz/) coming in 2025, managed by Open Collective Inc., the original company&#x20;

## **Who operates Open Collective (the "classic" platform)?**

***

The "classic" Open Collective platform is operated by OFi Technologies, a US-based LLC company.\
\
OFi Technologies is 100% owned by OFi Consortium., a 501(c)(6) US-based nonprofit.\
\
OFi Consortium is governed by its members, who join based on their direct utilization of transparent financial ledgers with a demonstrated commitment to transparent financial ledgers and a common interest in advancing related technologies.\
\
The current members are:

* Open Source Collective, an organization supporting open-source projects
* Open Collective Europe, which supports initiatives in Europe
* Gift Collective, which supports initiatives in New Zealand

## How are we financed?

***

OFi Consortium is financed by members who pay membership fees based on their financial capabilities and the level of influence they desire on the organization.\
\
OFi Technologies is financed by tips given on transactions from financial contributors and fees paid by platform customers.\
\
The total combined budget for the organizations is around $1,000,000 in 2025.
