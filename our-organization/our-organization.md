# Our Organization

We believe that people have the power to make the world better, if they work together. That’s why we set up Open Collective, a platform that empowers collectives with a passion - and connects them with people who can help them thrive.

Since launching in 2015, we’ve created an ecosystem that reaches across the world. We provide a place for all sorts of organizations to raise funds, manage expenses, and make an impact.

Open Collective is about community, solidarity, and hope - and we’ve built our company with that in mind, every step of the way.
