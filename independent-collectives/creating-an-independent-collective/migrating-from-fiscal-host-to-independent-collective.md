# Migrating from Fiscal Host to Independent Collective

If you are currently a hosted Collective and want to become independent, follow the steps below.

Remember that once you go independent, you will no longer have the support of a host with your finances and other admin, and you will need your own bank account and legal status.

You will not be able to move your Collective until you have restored your balance to zero.

To find out how to do this, go to our page on [Withdrawing Collective Funds.](broken-reference)
{% endhint %}

### To migrate from a Fiscal Host:

1. Ensure that your Collective's balance is empty.
2. Go to the "Fiscal Host" option in your "Settings" menu and select "Remove Host"
3. Choose the "Independent Collective" option, and confirm
4. Connect your bank account and Stripe account in the "Receiving Money" section of your "Settings"
5. Make sure your Legal Name is the same as the bank account owner for your new Independent Collective by checking in the "Info" section of "Settings" (you do not need to change your display name)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Once you move your Collective away from your Fiscal Host, your recurring contributors will be contacted by email and asked to re-confirm their credit card details upon the integration of your new Stripe account.

They will need to do this for their recurring contributions to continue.
{% endhint %}

### To restore your balance:

If you want to restore a balance you previously emptied, you should:

1. Go to your Collective's page
2. Click "Actions" and then "Add Funds"
3. Add the balance you removed, listing your Collective as the source
