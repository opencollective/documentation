# Creating an Independent Collective

Becoming an Independent Collective means that you can manage your funds in your own bank account.

You can opt to become independent and still use the features on the Open Collective platform, even if you are currently with a Fiscal Host or acting as a Fiscal Host yourself.

However, you will no longer receive the admin support of a Fiscal Host, which means you will need to handle your own finances, accounting and liability.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are not sure you are able to manage your Collective's finances or admin effectively, you should seriously consider [applying to a Fiscal Host](../../fiscal-hosts/fiscal-hosts.md).
{% endhint %}
