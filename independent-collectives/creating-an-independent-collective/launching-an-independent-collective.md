# Launching an Independent Collective

You can set up an Independent Collective on Open Collective in much the same way as a regular Collective.

However, you should remember that:

* You will need to have your own bank account
* You will need your own legal entity&#x20;
* You will have to carry out all administrative tasks within your own team
* You will need to have your own bank account
* You will need your own legal entity&#x20;
* You will have to carry out all administrative tasks within your own team

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are not sure you are able to manage your Collective's finances or admin effectively, you should seriously consider [applying to a Fiscal Host](../../fiscal-hosts/fiscal-hosts.md).
{% endhint %}

### Creating an Independent Collective

1. Go to [https://opencollective.com/create](https://opencollective.com/create) and select "For Any Community"
2. Create your Collective by filling in the form
3. Once your page is created, click on "Start Accepting Contributions"
4. Select "Independent Collective"

Alternatively, you can go to your Collective's "Settings" menu and find the "Fiscal Host" menu option.

When asked "Who will hold money on behalf of this Collective?", select "Independent Collective" and click the blue button to activate.
