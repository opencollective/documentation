# Migrating from Self-Hosted to Independent Collective

If you are currently set up as a Fiscal Host for one Collective, you may wish to transition to an Independent Collective. This option is more streamlined and easier for your community to understand.

If you wish to charge Host Fees or host multiple Collectives, you should remain as a Fiscal Host.

{% hint style="info" %}
**What's the difference between a Self-Hosted Collective and an Independent Collective?**\
\
"Self-hosting" occurs when a user sets up a Fiscal Host and uses it to manage one Collective. This can be useful if the admin is interested in hosting other Collectives that they may or may not control.

An Independent Collective is simply a Collective that manages its own finances and admin, and has its own bank account and legal status.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
You must empty your Collective's balance before moving it away from a Fiscal Host, even if you manage it yourself.

To find out how to do this, go to our [Withdrawing Collective Funds](broken-reference) section.

### Migrating a Host with no Collectives

In some cases, you may have been using Fiscal Host profile with no collectives to manage your budget.

If this is you, you should [contact support](https://opencollective.com/help) if you wish to become an Independent Collective. We will need to manually convert your Organization profile into a Collective profile.



### Migrating a Self-Hosted Collective to an Independent Collective

As long as you have emptied your Self-Hosted Collective's balance, you can become an Independent Collective by using the steps laid out in our [Migrating from Fiscal Host to Independent Collective page](migrating-from-fiscal-host-to-independent-collective.md).

[Please contact support](https://opencollective.com/help) if you have any issues.
