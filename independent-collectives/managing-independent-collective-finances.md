# Managing Independent Collective Finances

There are some workflows you need to be familiar with to enable the operations of your Independent Collective. As you are in control of and responsible for the back office admin, it's up to you to process money coming in and out.



## Receiving Money&#x20;

To enable people to contribute to your Independent Collective, you need to set up ways that they can pay you. Learn more about this in the [Receiving Money](../fiscal-hosts/receiving-money/) section.&#x20;

## Sending Money&#x20;

If you wish to use Open Collective's integrations with payment processors to enable paying expenses in one click, you can learn to do so in our Sending Money section.&#x20;

If you do not want to link these services, you can pay expenses by other means outside the platform (e.g manual bank transfer), and mark them as paid manually on Open Collective. Alternatively, you can utilize the [Vendors ](../fiscal-hosts/managing-your-collectives/vendors.md)feature to pay expenses to organizations without Open Collective profiles.
