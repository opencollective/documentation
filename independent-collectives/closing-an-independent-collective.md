# Closing an Independent Collective

You can close down an Independent Collective for any reason, as long as you have emptied its balance first.

At this point, you can either:

### Close your Independent Collective&#x20;

This will cancel all of your recurring contributions.

1. Ensure your balance is at zero by withdrawing your funds by [submitting expenses](../expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses/).
2. Go the "Fiscal Host" option in your "Settings" and choose "Reset Fiscal Host"
3. Choose to either [archive or delete your Collective](../collectives/closing-a-collective/)

### Move to a Fiscal Host&#x20;

1. Ensure your balance is at zero by withdrawing your funds by [submitting expenses](../expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses/).
2. Go the "Fiscal Host" option in your "Settings" and choose "Reset Fiscal Host"
3. [Choose and apply to a Fiscal Host](../collectives/choosing-a-fiscal-host.md)
