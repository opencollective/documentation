# Giving to Collectives

Collectives around the world are doing great work. But they need support to thrive.\
\
Using Open Collective, you can search for groups that share your ideals or interests and back them with a one-off or regular donation. You can even contribute directly to a Fiscal Host to support organizations working with many collectives at once.

Open Collective makes this process easy. You can contribute as an individual or as a company, and we even provide an annual report which you can download for tax purposes.
