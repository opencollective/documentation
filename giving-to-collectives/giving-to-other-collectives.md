# Giving to Other Collectives

## Within the same Fiscal Host

If both Collectives are in the same Fiscal Host, you can donate using the balance of a Collective.&#x20;

To make a Collective-to-Collective donation, go to the page of the Collective and select your contribution amount. Simply make a contribution to your desired Collective and select your Collective as the payment method during checkout. There are no fees for utilizing your collective balance.&#x20;

## Across different Fiscal Hosts&#x20;

We donâ€™t currently have a direct workflow for sending money between Fiscal Hosts. If you need to do so:&#x20;

1. Contact the Fiscal Host of the Collective you wish to make a contribution towards and ask them to submit an expense to your Collective for your donation. &#x20;
2. You will then approve the expense, and your Fiscal Host will pay the other Fiscal Host.&#x20;
3. The other Fiscal Host will then allocate your donation to the Collective manually via added funds.&#x20;
