# Platform Tips

When you are making a [contribution to a collective](broken-reference), you will also be asked if you want to add a platform tip. This is totally optional, and the amount can be changed to any amount you wish.

#### What is a platform tip?

A platform tip is a donation to the Open Collective platform which is added on to your contribution.

By adding a platform tip, you’re helping us keep the platform running smoothly and enabling us to add new features.

#### Where is my platform tip going?

When you add a platform tip to your total, you’re giving to the Open Collective platform, in addition to your chosen Collective.

When you add a platform tip to your total, you’re giving to the Open Collective platform, in addition to your chosen Collective.

The Open Collective platform remains sustainable due to our investors and the platform fees from hosts. [You can find out more about our pricing here](../why-open-collective/pricing.md).

However, your optional platform tips also play a huge role in helping us to maintain and improve the platform.

#### Adding a platform tip

Click on any Collective, and access the “contribute” option in the menu. You will then see a range of ways you can support. Select the applicable option and you will be taken to the “contribute to…” page.

Once you have set the level and frequency of your donation, you will be able to edit your platform tip by adjusting the tip settings.

There are four ways to set your platform tip total:

* Keep the platform tip at the default amount
* Adjust the slider to your chosen total
* Select your currency, and type in your amount in the box&#x20;
* Add a tip which is a percentage of your contribution

Remember to check your total to ensure that you are happy with your tip amount. You can change your tip at any point up until you complete your payment.

#### Giving directly to the platform

If you want to support the platform without making a contribution to a collective, you can give directly to Open Collective by searching for it in the collectives directory and making a contribution as normal.

[You can find Open Collective and arrange a one-off or recurring contribution here](https://opencollective.com/opencollective)
