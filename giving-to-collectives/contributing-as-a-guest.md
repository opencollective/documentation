# Contributing as a Guest

If you donâ€™t want to create an Open Collective account, you can still make donations to collectives, but only one-time contributions.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Recurring donations require an Open Collective account.
{% endhint %}

You will still need to provide an email address, but do not have to enter your name. **Guest contributions are not a reliable way of staying anonymous on Open Collective.** Please use our [incognito contribution](contributing.md#contribute-as) feature if you require privacy.

#### Making a guest contribution

To give money as a guest, visit the Contribute page for your chosen collective. If you have an Open Collective account, make sure you are not logged in.

Select a one-time contribution, and the amount you wish to give.

On the next page, select Contribute as Guest. You must provide a contact email for the receipt, but adding a name is optional.

Fill in your preferred payment method, and complete your contribution. You will shortly receive an email confirming your donation.

#### Claiming a Guest Account&#x20;

In order to transition your guest account to an Open Collective account you just need to login using the email address that you used to create the guest contribution.&#x20;
