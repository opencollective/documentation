# Contributing

So you've found a community that is working on a cause you care about and would like to make a financial contribution? This is the guide for you.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Looking for a Collective to support? [Read our guide](../getting-started/explore.md).
{% endhint %}

### When you're ready to give

Many collectives offer [donation tiers](../collectives/raising-money/setting-goals-and-tiers.md), some of which come with rewards. You can also choose to make a “custom contribution”, and select a one-time, monthly or yearly contribution, as well as the amount you wish to give.

You will also be asked if you want to add a platform tip, which helps us to add new features and updates to the platform. Visit our [platform tip page ](platform-tips.md)to find out more.

### Set your identity

If you’re logged into your Open Collective account, you can select the profile that you want to contribute with. Open Collective allows you to give as an individual, an organisation, or another Collective.

If you don’t want to set up an account, you can[ contribute as a guest.](contributing-as-a-guest.md)

#### Contribute as...

You are able to select who the contribution is from. If you don’t log in to Open Collective you can contribute as:

* **A guest account:** Don’t want to create an account on Open Collective? That’s fine, just add your name and email address and we’ll do the rest.

If you are logged in, you will have the option to choose from:

* **Your personal account:** You will be listed as a contributor on the collective’s page, and the email address linked to your account will be visible to the collective admins.&#x20;
* **Incognito:** Stay Anonymous. We understand that not everyone can or wants to show their real name on public Collective budgets. The amount you give will be public, but your name and details will not. Administrators of the Collective and Fiscal Host, and certain Open Collective staff members will still be able to see your details.
* **An Organization:** If you are an admin, you can give on behalf of an organization, including Fiscal Hosts. [Find out more about setting up an organization.](../getting-started/creating-an-organization.md)
* **A Collective:** If you are an admin, you can give on behalf of a collective. Find out more about [giving as a collective.](giving-to-other-collectives.md)

Accidentally contributed from the wrong account or received a contribution in the wrong place? [Contact us](https://opencollective.com/contact) directly, and we can help you move the contribution to the correct place.
{% endhint %}

#### Payment

You will then be asked to submit a payment method. Each Fiscal Host has a different range of payment options and providers. To find out more, go to our [Payment Options](payment-methods.md) page or contact the Collective's Fiscal Host.

#### Leaving a message

To leave an optional message with your contribution, go to the Our Contributors section of the collective’s page. Find your name and write your message in the designated space.\
