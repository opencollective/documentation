# Requesting Refunds

If you wish to receive a refund on your contribution for any reason, please reach out to the Collective or the Collectiveâ€™s Fiscal Host directly, or contact us [via our support page](https://opencollective.com/contact).

{% hint style="info" %}
For a more comprehensive breakdown of how we handle refunds, please read our [Refund Policy](refund-policy.md).
{% endhint %}

If you're having trouble reaching the relevant party to process your refund, Open Collective will help pass your request on to the appropriate people. Only in extreme cases will Open Collective as a platform intervene and issue refunds.

To make the process easier, you will need to include:

* Your name
* Details of your refund request
* The name of the Collective
* The amount
* The date you made the contribution

Each Fiscal Host has their own policy regarding refunds, so check their terms and conditions for clarification.

We will notify you of the result of your request. If your refund is approved, we will be in touch to arrange for the money to be returned to your chosen account.
