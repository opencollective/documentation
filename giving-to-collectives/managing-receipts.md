# Managing Receipts

You can view a record of all the contributions you have made to Collectives in your Open Collective account.

This means you can search payments by Collective or time period and download your receipts.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Is my contribution tax deductible?**

This depends on the status of the collective’s Fiscal Host. If the host has tax-exempt status, your contribution may be tax-deductible. If in doubt, reach out to the Fiscal Host for confirmation.
{% endhint %}

### Finding your receipts

There are two ways that you can locate and download your receipts.

If you are searching your account for a transaction, make sure you are signed in with the same email address you used to make the contribution.

### Searching your account for receipts

To find a list of your receipts, navigate to your Dashboard > Settings > Payment Receipts.

You will then be able to search a list of all your contributions. You can:

* Use the Search function to find a specific transaction
* Use the Download Receipts option to download all receipts from a specific time period

### Searching a Collective’s page for your transaction

You can also find your receipt by searching the Collective’s budget.

1. Ensure you are[ signed in](https://opencollective.com/signin?next=%2F) with the email address you used to process the transaction.
2. Go to the page for the Collective you supported
3. Find the Budget menu
4. Click "Transactions." You will then have the option to View All Transactions.
5. Use the Search Transactions box to find your name, and filter using the dropdown boxes.
6. When you find the right contribution, you will have an option to download a PDF of your receipt.

### Changing the details on your receipt

You can change certain details on your receipt after the contribution has been made, such as your address.

To do this, navigate to your Dashboard > Settings > Info, and update your details.

The next time you generate a receipt, your details will automatically be updated to the new information.

### Tax displayed on receipts

Receipts only show the tax amount when hosts are subject to either VAT (EU) or GST (NZ). For all other cases, this column will always display 0%
