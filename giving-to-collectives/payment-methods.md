# Payment Methods

Contributors can choose from a variety of payment options on Open Collective.

Your choices will depend on:

* Which collective you are giving to
* How much you are giving
* Whether you are making a one-off or recurring payment
* Which currency you are giving
* Your location

{% hint style="warning" %}
In some rare cases, it may be possible to use cryptocurrencies to give to a collective, but not all. Check with your Fiscal Host to see if they support crypto for your transaction.
{% endhint %}

#### Choosing your payment option

Once you have selected your amount and the account you want to use to give, you will be asked to select your preferred payment option.

Depending on what payment methods the receiving Fiscal Host has enabled, these may include:

* Any payment methods you previously saved on Open Collective
* A credit card
* A payment provider, such as Google Pay, Apple Pay or PayPal
* An ACH “wire” or SEPA “direct debit” transfer
* Your Collective balance
* Manual bank transfer

{% hint style="info" %}
If you would like to pay via a physical check, contact the Fiscal Host of the collective you're contributing to directly.
{% endhint %}

Payment methods that require bank authorization (such as ACH, SEPA or BACS) may take up to two weeks to complete. We will email you once the payment has finished processing.

If you don’t complete a manual bank transfer, the pending order will expire after two months and no further action will be required.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you attempt to schedule a recurring contribution via PayPal and it fails, you may be charged for all your failed scheduled donations once you reestablish the connection.
{% endhint %}

#### Setting up a preferred payment method

If you want to save time when making contributions, you can set up a preferred payment method.

Open Collective does not store any credit card numbers. Your details are stored via our secure payment partner, Stripe, so your credit cards are safe even if our systems are compromised.

#### To set up your payment method:

1. Navigate to your personal account Dashboard > Settings.
2. Click “Payment Methods.” You will be prompted to add a Credit Card.
3. Fill in your Credit Card details in the space provided.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Updating your payment method does not change the card which your contributions are currently being made with.&#x20;

If you want to change the payment method of one of your subscriptions you will need to cancel the subscription and set up a new one with the desired card and amount. Go to the [Making a Recurring Payment](making-a-recurring-contribution.md) page to learn more.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### Removing or changing your payment method

If you wish to remove or change your preferred payment method, go to your Payment Methods page.

Each card you have added will have its own entry, with the option to “Remove” on the right hand side.

If your card is linked to any recurring contributions on Open Collective, you will need to cancel these contributions before you can remove the card.
