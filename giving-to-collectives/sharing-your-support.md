# Sharing your Support

\
Spreading the word about a Collective can boost awareness about their work, and help more backers discover them.

So why not tell your friends and colleagues about the groups that mean something to you?

### Adding a badge to your website

If you want to tell people which Collectives you’re backing, add this script to your website:

`<script src="`[`https://opencollective.com/USERNAME/collectives.js?role=backer`](https://opencollective.com/:username/collectives.js?role=backer)`"></script>`

Make sure to replace  `USERNAME` with your individual profile's handle. This can be found in your profile settings.&#x20;

You can change your role by editing “role=backer” to “role=admin”, “role=member” or “role=host”, or simply leave it empty.

### Sharing on social media

You can also let people know about your support on your social platforms.

This can also be a great opportunity to reach people outside your immediate network and community.

When sharing:

* Add a brief description of what the collective does, and why it’s important
* Include a link to their Contribute To page on Open Collective, or their website
* If they have an account on that social platform, find it and tag them into your message
* Share a little about why this work matters to you specifically
