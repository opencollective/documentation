# Giving as a Company

Open Collective doesn’t just support individual contributions. We can help your company give to collectives you care about.

We also provide customizable reports and receipts that can be generated for your tax reporting.

To make a contribution as a company, you will need an organization account. You will need to give through this account if you want your company link and logo to appear on the Collective's "Contributors" page.

{% hint style="success" %}
Go to our [Creating an Organization](../../getting-started/creating-an-organization.md) section to learn about setting up and personalizing your organization on Open Collective.
{% endhint %}

Once you’ve done this:

1. Select a Collective and go to their “Contribute To…” page as normal.
2. Select your amount and the frequency of your donation, or pick a pre-defined tier.
3. When you are asked who you want to Contribute As, select your Organization from the drop-down menu.
