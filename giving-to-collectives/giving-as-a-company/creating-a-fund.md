# Creating a Fund

By creating a fund, you can make payments to one single pot, which can then be distributed to multiple Collectives.

A fund can be run on behalf of a single company, or it can be set up around a cause, with multiple companies and individuals paying in.

### Why set up a fund?

Setting up a fund with a strong belief and identity can be extremely impactful.

It can demonstrate that there is a source of help and support for people in a certain field or discipline, and show that your company has the interests of the ecosystem at heart.

It can also streamline your invoicing. With a fund, you just need to pay into one pot, rather than managing multiple invoices to different Collectives over several months.

Here are some examples of successful funds set up by one or more companies:

* [Google Open Source Fund](https://opencollective.com/google)
* [Airbnb Fund](https://opencollective.com/airbnb)
* [Indeed Fund](https://opencollective.com/indeed)

## Payout Using a Fund

If your organization runs a fund, you’re in control of who gets paid, and why.&#x20;

You can decide to appoint an internal team to make awarding decisions, or a group representing multiple organizations.

You may also allow projects to request support from you directly by including a Request Grant button on your fund’s page on Open Collective.

To make a contribution using the balance of your fund, you can also go to the Collective’s Contribute To page.

When asked to choose the profile who is making the payment, select the name of the fund.

If the project or Collective you want to support is not on Open Collective, don’t worry: You can still contribute to their cause by [inviting them to submit an expense](../../collectives/spending-money/inviting-a-third-party-to-submit-an-expense.md).
