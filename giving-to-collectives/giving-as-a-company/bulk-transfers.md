# Bulk Transfers

Let’s say that your organization wants to make several contributions to different collectives on the Open Collective platform. If you made each of these transactions individually, they would each be subject to their own payment processing fee.

In these cases, many Fiscal Hosts offer Bulk Transfers.

Bulk Transfers allow your organization to send them the total funds in one transfer, which they then deposit in your organization’s balance.

Once the money has arrived, you can share it with one or many collectives, as you wish.

Fiscal Hosts have different processes around Bulk Transfers, so contact the appropriate host in advance to clarify what you need to do.
