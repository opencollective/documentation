# Gift Cards

If you want to inspire your employees or community members to discover Collectives they love, give them a Gift Card.

Gift cards can:

* Empower and reward your staff
* Encourage employees to explore Collectives in their industry, or their neighborhood
* Help build links between your company and the people you support
* Build your reputation as a generous company

To find out more about the benefits of gift cards — and who’s using them — [go to our Gift Cards page](https://opencollective.com/gift-cards).

### Giving out Gift Cards

You can issue gift cards for special events, or even as a monthly or annual perk for employees or community members.&#x20;

To create your gift cards, go to your organization’s Dashboard > Settings > Gift Cards.

Then click on the blue Create Gift Cards button.

You will then be able to set:

* The value of each card
* Your payment method
* The expiry date of each gift card
* The name of the batch of cards you are creating
* Whether you want to limit to certain hosts
* Any custom messages you want to send



You can also choose how you want to distribute your cards. You can do this:

* **By Email:**  Give us a list of emails and we’ll send the gift cards out. Or generate gift card codes, and send them yourself.
* **By downloading a list of redeem codes:** If you’re making your own custom materials, you can generate codes or links to add to the designs.
* **By downloading printable gift cards as a PDF:** You can print out your own cards to hand out as flyers at events or other gatherings.



### Payment methods for Gift Cards

If you are a small company issuing a small number of gift cards, you can set up a credit card in a few minutes.

However, each gift card charge is counted as a new credit card transaction. Therefore, we strongly recommend using a pre-paid balance to avoid credit card processing fees, especially if you plan to issue many gift cards.

### Redeeming Gift Cards

To use the gift card, the recipient will need to go to the [Redeem Gift Card](https://opencollective.com/redeem) page, and add their name, email address and gift card code.

They should then:

* Search for a Collective or project they want to support
* Go to their Contribute To page
* Select Gift Card when asked to choose their payment method

You will only be charged for a gift card when it is used by the recipient. Gift cards expire by default after a year, unless you set a custom expiry date when you create them. If they are not redeemed, you will not be charged.

Once the card has been redeemed, the recipient can spend the money on one or many Collectives until the balance runs out. They do not need to spend the money in one go.

When the money is given to a collective, their budget will show that the recipient used a gift card from your company. You will also show up as a sponsor of the collective.

### Tracking Gift Card activity

From the "Gift Cards" page in your Organization Settings menu, you can keep track of:

* Which cards have been redeemed, and by whom
* Which cards have not yet been claimed
* The date they were sent out
* The date each card expires

You will also receive a consolidated monthly invoice from the Fiscal Host for your records.
