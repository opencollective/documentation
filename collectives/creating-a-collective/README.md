# Creating a Collective

You’ll need an Open Collective account to create a Collective. To find out how to do that, go to [Setting up your account](../../getting-started/setting-up-your-account.md).&#x20;

Once you’ve done that, click on your profile picture in the top right hand corner and click on the Create a Collective button or press the + next to my collectives. You will see two options:

1. **For Open Source projects**

This is for anyone that wants to set up an open source collective. You’ll be directed to apply to the Open Source Collective (OSC) Fiscal Host.&#x20;

You’ll need to complete a short verification process.

2. **For the community**

If you’re starting any other kind of collective, select this option. You’ll be asked to fill in some details, including the name of your collective, your preferred collective URL, and a brief description of what you do.

There’s no verification process for this option, so you’re ready to take the next step.



## Getting Your Collective Set Up

Open Collective provides several options to help you set up your team, manage security, and add policies and details that help you make your purpose clear.&#x20;

In order to receive money or pay out expenses, you need a [Fiscal Host](broken-reference) or you need to be set up as an [Independent Collective](broken-reference).

Whether you have a Fiscal Host yet or not, here are some steps you can take to get your Collective started.

Customizing your collective can help attract potential collaborators and raise funding for your cause.



[**Fill in your information**](broken-reference)

Complete your basic details, including your name, location, and currency.

[**Customize your profile page**](../../getting-started/editing-your-profile-page.md)

Update your images and choose what people see when they visit your page.

[**Add your team**](../../getting-started/adding-and-removing-team-members.md)

Add your team members/collaborators who can help you manage your collective page and what they can access.

[**Set goals and tiers**](../raising-money/setting-goals-and-tiers.md#setting-goals)

Get your targets and offer incentives to your community.

[**Create your policies**](creating-your-policies.md)

Provide guidance to expense submitters.

[**Boost your security**](security-for-collectives.md)

Select 2FA to raise your security level.

[**Add buttons to your website**](../raising-money/adding-donation-buttons-badges-and-banners.md)

Explore our catalog of buttons and banners. Show your audience where they can contribute.

[**Start tracking your Expenses** ](../../expenses-and-getting-paid/expenses-and-getting-paid.md)

Submit expenses through your collective, so others can see where money will be spent (even if you don't have any yet). This builds trust with potential supporters.&#x20;

[**Choosing a Fiscal Host**](../choosing-a-fiscal-host.md)

If you would prefer not to hold money on behalf of your community a Fiscal Host can act as a 'host' for your project.&#x20;
