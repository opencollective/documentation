# Linking Connected Collectives

When a Collective or initiative takes off, it’s not uncommon for local projects or separate Collectives to branch out from it.

You have the ability to display these “Connected Collectives” on your Collective page, so that people can view and potentially support these spinoff initiatives. These are displayed on the Collective’s page under “More Ways to Contribute”.

Connected Collectives:&#x20;

* Don't share a budget&#x20;
* They can have different Fiscal Hosts, with different currencies&#x20;
* Admins of one Collective are not automatically admins of the other\
  \
  This feature can also be used by Organizations to show Collectives and users who are part of their group.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This option needs to be enabled manually by the Open Collective team.

Please ensure you have received approval from the admins of the Collectives you would like to connect with before reaching out to our team.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
