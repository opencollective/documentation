# Events

If you want to bring your community together, you can set up an Event and post it on your Collective page. You can also sell tickets for the Event. The proceeds of any sales will go directly to your Collective’s budget.

### **Creating an Event**

The first step is to go to your Collective's page and scroll down to the “Events” section. Click on the “Create Event” button.

You will then have the option to fill in your Event details, including a **name, short description, start and end times, your preferred time zone, your event URL, your location, and any private instructions**. Private instructions will be sent by email to registered participants and/or attendees.

The currency of your event will always be the same currency as the Collective.
{% endhint %}

### Customizing your event

Once you’ve created your event, you can access it via the “Events” section on your Collective's page.

From your Event’s page, you can add a profile image, as well as a cover image by clicking the buttons in your top banner.

To customize your event info, Navigate to your Event Dashboard > Settings.&#x20;

From there, you can:

* View event activity
* Change your event info
* Style your event page
* Customize the emails sent to contributors/attendees
* Export data of contributors/attendees
* Add/Remove event team members
* Create tickets
* Set support tiers
* Create webhooks to build integrations
* Empty your balance, archive or delete your event

{% hint style="info" %}
Many of these options operate in the same way as your Collective settings. Go to [Customizing Your Profile Page](../getting-started/editing-your-profile-page.md) to find out more.
{% endhint %}

### Create Event Tickets

You can create tickets for your Event through Open Collective.&#x20;

To create a ticket, navigate to your Events Dashboard > Ticket Tiers. Click “Create Ticket”&#x20;

From here, you’ll be able to enter the following information:\
\
**Name:** The name of the ticket (For example, “Donation”, “Gold Sponsor”, etc).

**Description:** A short summary of what the ticket includes or is for.\
\
**Amount type:** How much your ticket costs. You can set a fixed amount, or a flexible amount. You can suggest ticket prices for a flexible ticket, including default and minimum amounts.

**Available quantity:** How many tickets you want to make available. Tickets will be unlimited if you leave this field empty.

**Button text:** Customize the text on the button to select tickets. The text will be “RSVP” if this field is left empty.

**Goal:** How much you want to raise.\
\
You also have the option to add a standalone page for this ticket, where you can add more detailed information and videos. You can use the URL for this standalone page to share and market your ticket directly.

To remove tickets, click on the “Remove Ticket” text in the top right corner.



### Create Event Sponsorship Tiers

Tiers can be used if people want to donate to your Event, but not attend. You can invite flexible contributions, or create your own tiers.

**Flexible Contributions:** These allow contributors to set their own amount and frequency. It is selected as a default option, but you can disable it.

**Create your own tiers:** Create a tier with its own name and description. Set a fixed donation amount and frequency, and limit to a certain number if you wish.

You can choose from a number of different tier types, including the generic tier, membership (recurring), a service (such as access to support), a product (such as merch) or a donation (gift).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you’d like to email your event attendees, you can do so by using [Updates](../advanced/keeping-your-community-updated/).
{% endhint %}

### Managing team members

All Collective team members are part of the Event team, but you can add or remove team members from your Event without affecting the Collective's team.&#x20;

If you add a team member to an Event, they do not become an admin of your Collective. Therefore, you can give people responsibility for an Event without giving them access to the Collective itself.

### Emptying an Event’s balance

You can transfer all funds in your Event balance to its parent Collective by navigating to your Event Dashboard > Settings > Advanced, and selecting "Empty Event Balance".

Need to transfer money between your Event and Collective? Head to the moving money section.

You can only archive or delete an Event if the balance is zero.

### **Closing an Event**

If you wish to close down an Event, you can archive it or delete it. In either case, you will need to zero the Event’s balance. Learn more about moving your Event's money in the [moving money section. ](managing-money/moving-money.md)

Navigate to your Event's Dashboard > Settings > Advanced.&#x20;

**Archive your Event**&#x20;

Archiving your Event means it will visually appear inactive, and no new activity will be allowed.

**Delete your Event**

You can only delete your Event if there is no transaction history. This enables us to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the ledger.&#x20;
