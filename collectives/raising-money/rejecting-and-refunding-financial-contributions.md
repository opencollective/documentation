# Rejecting and Refunding  Financial Contributions

Our moderation features give you control over who is able to donate to your Collective.&#x20;

You can choose to reject and refund any contribution and even block contributions from selected accounts or groups.

You can reject financial contributions for any reason, but if you want to clarify the types of donations you will not accept, you can outline your terms in your Contribution Policy.

Navigate to your Collective's Dashboard > Settings > Policies.&#x20;

### Rejecting financial contributions

You can reject a donation from any person or group.

This will:

* refund the financial contributor
* cancel any future recurring contribution
* remove their membership from your Collective so they are not listed as a sponsor

{% hint style="info" %}
If enabled by the Fiscal Host, Collective admins can reject and/or refund financial contributions for up to 30 days after they are made. Fiscal Host admins have the capacity to refund contributions indefinitely. We recommend Fiscal Hosts have their own refund policy. You can learn more about this in the [Fiscal Host Policies](../../fiscal-hosts/setting-up-a-fiscal-host/fiscal-host-policies.md) section.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

To reject a contribution:

1. Navigate to your Collective's Dashboard >  Transactions
2. Find the contribution
3. Click "View Details"
4. Click the “Reject” button.

You can also send them a message, explaining the reasons for your decision.&#x20;

Confirm your decision, and your budget will be updated to show the rejection as well as the refund.

### Rejecting categories of financial contributor

You may choose to prohibit certain types of group from contributing to your Collective.

We offer the option to block the following groups:

* Adult websites
* Casino/gambling websites
* SEO services
* VPN/proxy services
* Essay writing services
* Affiliate/review services

If you wish to block one or more of these, navigate to your Collective's Dashboard > Settings > Policies and find the drop-down under “Rejected Categories”.

Once you have made your selection, any account that has been tagged by the Open Collective team as belonging to one of these categories will not be able to contribute to your Collective.

They will be notified that they are blocked from contributing when they navigate to your “Contribute To…” page.

If you would like to let potential contributors to your Collective know upfront what your contribution policy is, and what kinds of contributions you may not accept, you can also do this in the 'Policies' section of the Collective menu. This will be displayed in the contribution flow as well.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is against Open Collective's community guidelines and moderation policy for a contributor to create a new account to get around the category filter. If this happens, [please report it to us](https://opencollective.com/contact).
