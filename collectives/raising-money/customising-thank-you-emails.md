# Customising Thank You Emails

When a supporter contributes to your Collective, Project or Event on Open Collective, they will receive an automated email message thanking them and offering extra information.

You can customize the text that your community receives in these emails to match your style and what you want to say.

### Custom Thank You Emails

You can edit the email message sent by your Collective by navigating to your Collective's Dashboard > Settings > Custom emails.&#x20;

Here you can use our text editor to compose your message. You can also add images if you wish.

You can use this space to include thanks, important information on future activities and events, and other important details.

This will be sent to anyone who donates to your Collective through the Open Collective platform.

### Custom Event or Project Emails

You can also customize the emails that are sent when someone donates to your Event(s) and/or Project(s), if you wish to include different wording.

If you do not fill in these sections, contributors to your Events and Projects will receive the text that you created for your Collective’s Custom Emails.

To customize these emails:

1. Find the Project or Event you want to customize on your Collective page
2. Click on it and find the “Settings” menu
3. Navigate to Settings > Custom Email and use that text editor as described in the [Custom Thank You Emails](customising-thank-you-emails.md#custom-thank-you-emails) section.
