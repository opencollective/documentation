# Collectives

There are thousands of different collectives currently growing on Open Collective.

Setting up a collective can be a great way for a group of people to work together on a shared goal or interest.

We help you to build all sorts of initiatives that make a difference. That might involve running a community kitchen or a mutual aid group, helping people in your neighborhood, or building resilience around your open-source software project.

Establish the backbones for your next meetup group, union, climate activist collective, or political movement.

{% hint style="info" %}
On Open Collective you can:\


* Get started without the paperwork&#x20;
* Raise money and accept contributions without setting up a bank account&#x20;
* Pay bills and expenses quickly and simply&#x20;
* Provide transparent budgeting for your community
* Meet and connect with other collectives.\


No need to incorporate, hire a lawyer and accountant, or define organizational roles!
