# Tagging expenses

Tagging your expenses can be a useful way to show how your money is being spent:

To add a tag, go to your expense, and find the “Add Tag” button next to your expense’s invoice number (underneath the title).

You can add and edit tags when the expense is created, or at any time afterwards. This means you can create your own consistent categories, such as:

* Employees (wages and benefits)
* Contractors (invoices from suppliers/freelancers)
* Accounting (invoices, auditor fees)
* Software (subscriptions to software and SaaS products)
* Meals and Entertainment (Team lunches and client meetings, etc)
* Workspace (Home office costs or coworking expenses)
* Travel (Transportation and associated costs)
* Donations (contributions to other entities)

Decide on the best ones for you, and refine them as you go.&#x20;
