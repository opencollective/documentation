# Projects

Projects are a lightweight way for collectives to raise money and manage budgets for a specific initiative or idea.

A Project has its own balance and record of contributions and expenses. It can set contribution tiers, offer rewards, establish goals, give updates to backers, and have its own admins.

However, a project is separate from the Collective that runs it. That means it can only spend the budget it has (rather than the entire Collective budget). However, a Collective can allocate part of its overall budget to the Project if it chooses.

For an example of a Project in action, see [Bushwick Ayuda Mutua’s Asylum Seekers Fund](https://opencollective.com/bushwick-ayuda-mutua/projects/asylum-seekers-fund).

### Creating a Project

To create a Project, go to your Collective’s page. Ensure that you have your Projects section visible, you will then have the ability to “Create Project”.&#x20;

This will invite you to choose a name, a profile URL and add a short description of what the Project aims to achieve.

Once the Project is live, you can click on “settings” to edit and customize it. This includes:

* **Editing your info:** You can edit basic information, add tiers and goals and customize your page.&#x20;
* **Adding contribution tiers and goals:** This operates similarly to your collective page. [Learn more about this here](../raising-money/setting-goals-and-tiers.md).
* **Adding updates:** You can update your community on your Project’s progress. To enable, go to your Project’s “profile page” and select “always visible” next to your updates box. Learn more about [updates](../../advanced/keeping-your-community-updated/).&#x20;
* **Managing Team Members:** All Collective team members are part of the Project team, but you can add or remove team members from your project without affecting the Collective.

If you add a team member to a Project, they do not become an admin of your Collective. Therefore, you can give people responsibility for a Project without giving them access to the Collective itself.

### Closing a Project

If you wish to close down a Project you can Archive it or Delete it, in either case, you will need to zero the project’s balance. Learn more about moving your project's money on the [Moving money](moving-money.md) page.&#x20;

Navigate to your Projects Dashboard > Settings > Advanced.&#x20;

#### Archive your project

Archiving your project means it will visually appear inactive and no new activity will be allowed.

#### Delete your project

You can only delete your project if there is no transaction history. This enables us to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the ledger.
