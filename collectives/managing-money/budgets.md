# Budgets

Collectives have transparent budgets, where all transactions are reported. Everyone can see where the money comes from and what it's spent on.

You can choose to display a Simple Budget, with overall figures as well as expenses and contributions.

Or you can showcase your figures more visually with the Budget Visualization feature, which pulls information from your expenses and contributions and showcases them with varying graphs.

To switch between the two views:

1. Navigate to your Collective’s Dashboard > Settings&#x20;
2. Find “Profile Sections”
3. Use the drop-down menu next to “Budget” to toggle between “Always visible” (Simple Budget view) and “New version visible” (Budget Visualization).

### Simple Budget

Your Simple Budget will display:

* Most recent transactions
* Balance
* Total raised&#x20;
* Estimated annual budget

{% hint style="info" %}
Your estimated annual budget is calculated based on factors including:

* your active monthly subscriptions (multiplied by 12)
* your active yearly subscriptions
* any one-time contributions in the last year
* any inactive monthly subscriptions from the last year
{% endhint %}

Your budget will not show private information, such as the email addresses of your expense submitters and any receipts they attached.

You can also use the menu buttons to view a record of “expenses” (money going out) and “transactions” (money coming in).

If you choose to press the “view all expenses” or “view all transactions” links, you will be able to see a more complete list, and filter by various properties.

### Budget Visualization

You can use the Budget Visualization to help your community understand your finances.

It offers the same information as the Simple Budget, but breaks it down into useful graphs and clear categories.

This can be useful when telling the story about your financial status and well-being. For example, how does your collective spend its money? Is your funding consistent, or clustered around certain time periods?

To make the most of your Budget Visualization view, we recommend tagging your expenses.

You can find out more about how to do this in the [Paying Expenses](../spending-money/) section.
